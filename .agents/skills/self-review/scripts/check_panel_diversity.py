"""Panel lens-diversity gate (self-review Phase 2.6, --panel).

A multi-agent panel is only worth its cost if its reviewers cover *distinct*
concern axes. Left unchecked, independent reviewers converge on the same easy
themes (everyone flags "missing calibration") while whole high-risk axes go
unprobed — the panel collapses to fewer effective lenses than reviewers, and
the editor synthesis cannot tell monoculture from genuine consensus. This gate
post-processes the reviewers' structured output (the panel_review_template
schema the editor already collects) and reports these diversity and panel-independence failures:

  UNCOVERED_AXIS     an expected high-risk axis for this research type produced
                     ZERO major findings across the whole panel. Mirrors the
                     "completeness critic" pattern: name what nobody probed so
                     the editor can re-probe it before finalizing. (Major)
  FAMILY_MONOCULTURE the panel's major findings concentrate in ONE concern
                     family beyond a threshold (one family holds the majority),
                     a signal the lenses converged rather than spanned the
                     manuscript. (Major)
  LENS_COLLAPSE      one reviewer contributed only families that another
                     reviewer already covered — a fully-redundant lens that
                     added no independent signal. Distinct from healthy
                     CONSENSUS (a reviewer agreeing on SOME themes but also
                     raising at least one family nobody else did). Exempt when
                     the roster declares that reviewer on a DIFFERENT substrate
                     from the generator: agreement reached from another substrate
                     is corroboration, not a redundant assignment, and it is the
                     very lens SUBSTRATE_MONOCULTURE requires. Exempted ids are
                     reported in summary.lens_collapse_substrate_exempt. (Flag)
  SUBSTRATE_MONOCULTURE  every reviewer the roster declares shares the *generator's*
                     model substrate — a same-model panel inherits the blind spots that
                     produced the draft and is not an independent check. Fires only when
                     the roster declares the generator's and the reviewers' substrates and
                     none differs; absent substrate info => skipped. (Major)

Healthy consensus is preserved: a finding family raised by ≥2 reviewers is a
strength, not a defect. The gate only fires LENS_COLLAPSE when a reviewer's
ENTIRE contribution is redundant, and UNCOVERED_AXIS/MONOCULTURE on
panel-level coverage, never on agreement per se.

INPUTS
  --panel  JSON file. Either a list of reviewer objects, or an object with a
           "reviewers" list (and optional "research_type"). Each reviewer
           object needs reviewer_id, expertise_area, and major[] (with heading
           and/or comment text); minor[] is ignored for axis coverage.
  --research-type  one of: survival, sr_ma, radiomics, dta, observational,
           narrative (synonyms accepted). Overrides any value in the JSON.
           When unknown/absent, UNCOVERED_AXIS is skipped (cannot know the
           expected axes) and noted in the summary.
  --roster  roster manifest of SPAWNED reviewers. A list of ids, or
           {reviewers|roster: [{reviewer_id, substrate}]} with an optional top-level
           "generator_substrate". Enables PANEL_UNDERRETURN (spawned vs returned) and
           SUBSTRATE_MONOCULTURE (independence). substrate is a coarse lane label
           ("claude" | "codex" | "gpt" | "human"), not a model version.

OUTPUT
  A diversity table (stdout) and, with --out, a JSON artifact:
    {panel, research_type, claims[{verdict, severity, detail, where}], summary}
  summary carries the family histogram, concentration index, and the
  expected/covered/uncovered axes. Exit 1 (with --strict) when any Major claim
  exists; exit 2 on input error.

Stdlib-only (json / re / argparse / pathlib). Exit codes: 0 clean (or
report-only), 1 Major claim(s) found (with --strict), 2 input/usage error.
