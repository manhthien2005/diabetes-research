# Deterministic verifier for the effect-stability challenge card.
# Runs check_effect_stability.py on two synthetic manuscripts and diffs stdout
# against expected/. Stdlib-only, network-free. Exit 0 = both match and exit codes
# are correct. cd into HERE so the reported source path is the stable relative
# "fixture/..." (portable across CI checkout locations).
#
# Fixtures (synthetic only — no real manuscript, no PII):
#   effect_bad.md — Conclusions "OR 24.0; 95% CI 3.0-240.0" (80-fold, no caveat) +
#                   Methods "18 events for 3 covariates" (EPV 6.0)
#                   -> UNSTABLE_EFFECT_ESTIMATE + EPV_LOW.
#   effect_ok.md  — a tight CI (OR 2.4; 1.3-4.4, ratio 3.4) plus the SAME wide CI
#                   explicitly labelled "exploratory and imprecise ... a direction
#                   rather than a magnitude" -> silent (caveat suppresses the flag,
#                   tight CI is below threshold). The precision control.
