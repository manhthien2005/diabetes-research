"""The two review boxes are for two different readers. This checks they were written that way.

A journal review form has two free-text boxes: Confidential Comments to the Editor and
Comments to the Authors. They are adjacent, unvalidated, and go to different people. Two
things go wrong there, and neither is caught by reading the draft.

  1. THE RECOMMENDATION LEAKS. The recommendation lives only in the editor's box. SKILL.md
     says the blocks "must never be transposed" and Phase 4 asks for a forbidden-word check,
     both as prose. A transposition is not hypothetical: the two boxes sit adjacent on the
     form, a swap looks unremarkable while you are filling it in, and the last place it can
     be caught is the submission proof — one step from irreversible. Once submitted, the authors read the recommendation grade and the
     confidential remarks, and the editor gets the author-facing text.

  2. THE BOXES ARE THE SAME TEXT. A human writes the editor note at a different altitude from
     the author note: decision-oriented and terse for the editor, developmental and explanatory
     for the authors. Pasting the same sentences into both is a machine tell, and it wastes the
     attention of the one reader who opens both. Calibration: on a draft that had passed every
     other gate, 21 shared 6-grams, including one clause copied verbatim; rewriting the editor
     block in its own register took it to 3.

Technical phrasing always overlaps a little ("every k and Wilcoxon p in the"), so a small
floor is expected and the default threshold sits above it. A single long shared run fires on
its own, because one copied clause is the tell even when the totals look clean.

Verdicts:
  BOX_MISSING (major)                    one of the two blocks is absent
  RECOMMENDATION_IN_AUTHOR_BOX (major)   a recommendation grade appears in the authors' block
  BOX_DUPLICATION (minor)                the two blocks share too much literal text

Usage:
    check_review_boxes.py --review draft.md [--max-shared 8] [--out qc/boxes.json] [--strict]

Exit 0 unless --strict and a major fires. Stdlib only.
