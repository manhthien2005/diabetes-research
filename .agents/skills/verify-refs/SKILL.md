# Verify References (Audit-Only)

You help a medical researcher prevent reference hallucinations before submission.
This skill audits an existing manuscript or bibliography. It **does not write**
to `references/` or `manuscript/_src/refs.bib`. It does not discover new
literature; use `/search-lit` for discovery and `/lit-sync` for bib management.

## When to Use

- Before journal submission, especially for `.docx` manuscripts inherited from
  coauthors or external editors.
- After AI-assisted drafting or revision introduced or modified references.
- When a reviewer or collaborator flags a possibly fabricated citation.
- Before `/sync-submission` freezes a journal package.

## Inputs

1. Manuscript or bibliography path: `.md`, `.docx`, `.bib`, `.txt`, or `.tsv`.
2. Optional project root. Default: current working directory.
3. Optional flags passed to the script:
   - `--offline`: extract and classify references without API verification.
   - `--timeout N`: HTTP timeout seconds.

## Companion: pandoc citation key check

For markdown manuscripts using pandoc `[@bibkey]` citations, validate citation
keys first to catch undefined/unused keys before this audit. If you also use the
companion `manage-refs` skill, run its `check_citation_keys.py` for this;
otherwise use your reference manager's citation-key check.

Then run `verify_refs.py` against the .bib to validate each entry against
PubMed/CrossRef. The two checks are complementary: a citation-key check catches
mis-keyed cites; `verify_refs.py` catches fabricated metadata.

## Deterministic Script

Run the bundled script rather than verifying citations by memory:

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/verify_refs.py" manuscript/manuscript.md --project-root .
```

For hooks or quick manual runs, use the wrapper:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/verify_cli.sh" manuscript/manuscript.md --offline
```

**Manual pre-submission strict run** (Phase 1A.5):

```bash
"${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/verify_cli.sh" manuscript/index.qmd --strict
```

`--strict` forbids `--offline` and exits non-zero on any UNVERIFIED row.
Full checkpoint protocol: `references/manual_checkpoint_guide.md`.

The script uses DOI, PMID, CrossRef, PubMed E-utilities, and OpenAlex where
available. If network verification fails, it records `UNVERIFIED` rather than
silently passing.

**OpenAlex tertiary index (existence recovery).** PubMed covers only biomedical
literature and CrossRef's conference-proceedings coverage is uneven, so
NeurIPS / ICLR / ACL-style citations — common in medical-AI manuscripts — fall
through both and would be marked `UNVERIFIED`. After the PubMed and CrossRef tiers,
the script consults OpenAlex (`https://api.openalex.org`, free, no API key) **only
when no authoritative author list was obtained yet** (so a reference already
resolved by PubMed/CrossRef incurs no extra call). It resolves by DOI when present,
otherwise by a title search guarded by a token-similarity threshold so a fabricated
title cannot earn a spurious `OK`. This is the free analogue of the second index
(e.g. Scopus) that journal submission portals run alongside CrossRef. OpenAlex
display names carry no structured family/given split and mix `First Last` with
`Last, First` forms, so OpenAlex-sourced authors support an existence check plus a
tolerant first-author *membership* check, but never drive the strict positional or
author-count MISMATCH (those stay reserved for PubMed efetch / CrossRef). An
OpenAlex miss is recorded as `UNVERIFIED`, never `FABRICATED`. Pass `--no-openalex`
to restrict verification to PubMed + CrossRef.

## Output Contract (v1.3.0)

| Artifact | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Audit JSON | `qc/reference_audit.json` | Metadata audit output — row-level status (OK/MISMATCH/UNVERIFIED/FABRICATED), counts, `cited_authors[]`/`actual_authors[]`, `duplicate_findings[]`, submission-safe flag, full records |

**v1.2.0 (2026-05)** adds `duplicate_findings[]` to the audit JSON. Verbatim PMID or DOI duplicates within the reference list are flagged as MAJOR findings (resolves `/peer-review` Phase 2A P7). DOI normalization strips `https://doi.org/`, `http://dx.doi.org/`, `doi:` prefixes plus trailing slashes before comparison so `https://doi.org/10.x/abc/` and `10.x/abc` collapse to one key. Both `submission_safe` and `fully_verified` now require `duplicate_findings` to be empty.

**v1.3.0 (2026-05)** extends the author cross-check from first-author-only to the **full author list** and bumps `schema_version` to 4. For BibTeX inputs, every cited author family name is compared index-by-index against the authoritative source, and the cited-vs-source author counts are compared. PubMed `efetch.fcgi` (XML full record) is the truth source when a PMID is present — it is authoritative for given/family names where CrossRef is not (a documented case where CrossRef returned a wrong given name that PubMed efetch corrected). Records now carry `cited_authors[]`, `actual_authors[]`, `cited_author_count`, and `actual_author_count`. A correct first author does not establish that the remaining author names are authentic. Plain-text / TSV inputs, which cannot be parsed into a confident full list, degrade gracefully to the first-author check.

**Removed in Phase 1A.2** (per `docs/artifact_contract.md`):
- `references/verified_references.tsv` — record-level details now live inside `reference_audit.json` under `records[]`.
- `references/library.bib` — never this skill's concern. `/search-lit` produces candidates; `/lit-sync` (via Better BibTeX) writes `manuscript/_src/refs.bib`.

Sole-writer enforcement: `scripts/validate_project_contract.py` will flag any `references/*` file written by this skill as drift.

## Workflow

1. Identify the input file and project root.
2. Run `scripts/verify_refs.py`.
3. Read `qc/reference_audit.json`.
4. Report all `FABRICATED` and `MISMATCH` rows first (from `records[]`).
5. Report all `duplicate_findings[]` entries (verbatim PMID/DOI duplicates — cite renumbering required).
6. If `UNVERIFIED` rows remain, list them as manual checks and do not call the
   manuscript fully submission-safe. Rows with `note = "pagination_placeholder"`
   (`e000–e000` / `in press` / `TBD` / `forthcoming`) need the citation resolved
   before submission; `/self-review` Phase 2.5c decides whether any is a P0 blocker.
7. If the user needs a human-readable table, summarize from `records[]` in chat — do not write a TSV.

## Quality Gates

- Gate 1: stop submission if any row is `FABRICATED`.
- Gate 2: require user confirmation before accepting `UNVERIFIED` references.
- Gate 3: rerun after any reference edits.
- Gate 4 (added 2026-04-26; extended to full-author in v1.3.0): the cited
  author list is cross-checked against the authoritative source (PubMed efetch
  preferred, then CrossRef, then PubMed esummary). A row whose DOI/PMID resolves
  but whose cited authors do not match — at any index, or in total count — is
  downgraded to `MISMATCH`. First-author mismatches get
  `note = "first-author hallucination suspected"`; #2..#N family or count
  mismatches get `note = "non-first-author hallucination or count mismatch"`.
  This catches the LLM failure mode where a real DOI is paired with invented
  author names anywhere in the list, not just the lead author. Intentional CSL
  et-al truncation (cited fewer than source) can be silenced per-entry with a
  BibTeX `_audit_truncated = <N>` field.
- Gate 5 (added 2026-05, v1.2.0): PMID/DOI duplicate detection within the
  reference list. Verbatim duplicates (same PMID or normalized DOI) — a common
  LLM citation-compilation artifact — are flagged as MAJOR findings in
  `duplicate_findings[]`. `submission_safe == true` requires the list to be
  empty. Resolves `/peer-review` Phase 2A P7.
- Gate 6 (added 2026-06): pagination / publication-stage placeholders. A reference
  whose raw entry still carries `e000–e000`, `in press`, `TBD`, or `forthcoming`
  is not yet a fully citable record. Each is marked `UNVERIFIED` with
  `note = "pagination_placeholder"` (a would-be `VERIFIED` record is downgraded; a
  worse status is left unchanged). **verify-refs is manuscript-agnostic and does not
  judge centrality** — it only flags. The escalation call (is this a method- or
  headline-load-bearing citation, hence a P0 submission blocker?) is made by
  `/self-review` Phase 2.5c, which has the manuscript in hand.

**Classification note — citation-metadata confusion is not fabrication.** Digits
in a DOI suffix sometimes look like a journal article number but differ from the
real one (e.g., a DOI tail "77196" against article number 26068, or a "60466-1"
suffix against article 6274). This is cosmetic metadata confusion, not a
fabricated reference: do not record such rows as `FABRICATED` when the DOI/PMID
resolves and the authors match. A genuine `FABRICATED` verdict requires a
non-resolving identifier or an author cross-check failure (Gate 4), not a
mismatch between a DOI suffix and an article number.

## Author Cross-Check (Detail)

Two failure patterns motivate the author checks: a real DOI can be paired with
the wrong first author, and a correct first author can be followed by fabricated
co-author names. DOI resolution and first-author agreement alone cannot verify
the full author list.

- The authoritative author list is taken from PubMed `efetch.fcgi` (XML) when a
  PMID is present, falling back to CrossRef (DOI) and then PubMed esummary.
  efetch is preferred because CrossRef is unreliable for given names.
- For BibTeX inputs, the full cited list is parsed (`cited_authors[]`,
  balanced-brace aware, LaTeX-accent tolerant) and compared family-by-family and
  by total count against `actual_authors[]`.
- Comparison is tolerant: case, diacritics (NFKD plus Turkish/Polish/Czech/
  German/Nordic special letters), hyphen vs space, and name particles
  ("von", "van", "de", ...) are normalized before matching.
- If the cited authors cannot be parsed confidently, the check degrades to the
  first-author surname comparison, and if even that is empty it is skipped
  silently — no false MISMATCH from formatting ambiguity.
- Title-only PubMed search does not return an authoritative author and is
  therefore excluded from this check.
- Intentional truncation (a bib that cites only the first author, or first five
  + et al., by design) would otherwise trip the count check; mark such entries
  with `_audit_truncated = <N>` to downgrade the count mismatch to a note.

## Claim Fidelity — does the source say what you say it says?

`verify_refs.py` answers whether a reference is real and whose it is. It cannot answer
whether the *sentence citing it* is true of it, and a citation can be perfectly real while
the claim attached to it is not. That gap is where the failure lives: the DOI resolves, the
authors match, the reference list renders, and the sentence is still wrong.

`scripts/check_claim_fidelity.py` checks the claims that have a checkable answer, against
full texts you have already downloaded and converted (`/fulltext-retrieval` produces exactly
that layout — it never fetches anything itself):

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_claim_fidelity.py" \
  --manuscript manuscript/manuscript.md \
  --fulltext-dir fulltext/ --bib manuscript/_src/refs.bib \
  --out qc/claim_fidelity.json --strict
```

| Verdict | Severity | Fires when |
|---|---|---|
| `CITED_QUOTE_ABSENT` | major | Quoted text attributed to a source is not in it in any reading order. |
| `CITED_QUOTE_UNRESOLVED` | prompt | The quote matched only with foreign tokens wedged in, or a word or two missing — the signature of a dirty extraction, not of a fabrication. Look; do not assume. |
| `ATTRIBUTION_UNSUPPORTED` | prompt | Not one content word of the attributed claim appears in the source, in any form. Paraphrase normally keeps at least one of the source's own terms. |
| `ORDINAL_CLAIM_UNSUPPORTED` | prompt | "reports three strategies [12]" where the source discusses that noun but never that count near it. |

Only the quote verdict can fail `--strict`. Everything else is a prompt to go read the
source, because paraphrase is legitimate and a gate that blocks on it would be turned off.

**Read the "not checked" lines.** A citation with no full text on disk is reported as
unresolved and never guessed at, and a source whose extracted text is an abstract is reported
as too short to judge — absence proves nothing against an abstract. Silence from this
detector means "nothing checkable was wrong", which is not the same as "everything is right".

### Sentence-level source evidence table

The same `qc/claim_fidelity.json` now includes `evidence_rows`: recognized prose
sentence/citation pairs, manuscript coordinates, source-text and PDF hashes,
advisory retrieval identity, and a separate assessor-entered comparison. Initial
rows are `not_assessed`, even when bibliographic status is OK and no probe fires.

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_claim_fidelity.py" \
  --manuscript manuscript/manuscript.md --bib manuscript/_src/refs.bib \
  --fulltext-dir fulltext/ --retrieval-report pdfs/retrieval_report.json \
  --reference-audit qc/reference_audit.json \
  --out qc/claim_fidelity.json --evidence-table qc/claim_fidelity.md
```

Inspect the actual source before entering pages, excerpts, metric/unit/denominator,
population, direction, and a named assessment. Neither equal numbers nor matching
words establish support. Record whether the assessor used AI assistance; do not
describe an AI-generated assessment as human approval. Rerun with
`--reviewed-report qc/claim_fidelity.json` to retain annotations. Changed inputs
leave old assessments unresolved; unmatched rows remain in the JSON for review.
The Markdown table is a derived view, not a second editable evidence store.

See `references/claim_evidence_workflow.md` for field meanings, re-review steps,
source-identity limitations, and the difference between recorded and verified.

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- Does not fetch full texts (use `/fulltext-retrieval`); claim fidelity reads converted text
  off disk so it stays deterministic and CI-runnable.
- Does not automatically judge topical fit or semantic support. The probes check limited
  wording patterns; the evidence table records attributed assessments, not verified facts.
- Does not generate new references from memory.
- Does not replace missing citations with plausible alternatives without
  `/search-lit` or user approval.
- Does not sync Zotero collections; use `/lit-sync` after this audit.

## Anti-Hallucination

- Never fabricate titles, DOIs, PMIDs, author lists, journal names, years,
  volumes, or pages.
- Every OK row must be backed by DOI, PMID, CrossRef, or PubMed title evidence.
- If evidence is unavailable, mark `UNVERIFIED` and keep it visible.
