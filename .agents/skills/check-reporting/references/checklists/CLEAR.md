CLEAR is a **58-item** step-by-step reporting guideline for radiomics research, ordered by **manuscript
section** to follow a paper from title to open science: Title (1), Abstract (2), Keywords (3),
Introduction (4–6), Methods (7–43), Results (44–48), Discussion (49–52), and Open Science (53–58). The
Methods block is subdivided into Study design (7–12), Data (13–18), Segmentation (19–20), Pre-processing
(21–24), Feature extraction (25–28), Data preparation (29–33), Modeling (34–37), and Evaluation (38–43).

Two items — **53** and **58** — are marked **[n/e]** ("not essential" but recommended). All other items are
essential; score a missing essential item as a reporting gap, and a missing [n/e] item as N/A only when
justified. CLEAR is written for **hand-crafted radiomics**; for deep-learning pipelines without radiomic
features, CLAIM 2024 or TRIPOD+AI may fit better (a study that does both should be assessed against both).

Verification: all 58 items were compared against Table 1 of the published checklist (Europe PMC
full text, PMC10160267); 58/58 match, with no item missing and none invented.

## Notes for assessors

- **Order is by manuscript section, not by topic.** CLEAR numbers items in the order they appear in a paper
  (Title → Abstract → … → Open Science). When you cite a CLEAR item, cite it by this official number — item 1
  is the title, item 44 is baseline demographics in the Results, item 58 is sharing a ready-to-use system.
- **Items 53 and 58 are the only non-essential ([n/e]) items** — recommended best practice for open science.
  Every other item is essential; a missing essential item is a reporting gap, not an optional extra.
- **Segmentation items (19–20)** may be N/A for studies using fully automated, atlas-based segmentation with
  no reader involvement — note this rather than scoring MISSING.
- **Open Science (53–58)** is where a radiomics study's reproducibility is assessed and is increasingly
  required by journals; missing items here commonly draw reviewer comments.
- CLEAR was endorsed by the European Society of Radiology (ESR) and the European Society of Medical Imaging
  Informatics (EuSoMII). For methodological quality (as opposed to reporting completeness), pair CLEAR with
  METRICS (Kocak et al. 2024).
