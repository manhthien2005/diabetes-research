- **Licence:** CC BY 4.0. Item wording below is reproduced from the published statement with attribution.
- **Verified:** all 52 sub-items compared against the official supplements (ST1 expanded checklist, ST2 fillable checklist). 52/52 match in substance; the D/E designations match the statement exactly. Differences are orthographic only.

**TRIPOD+AI 2024 supersedes and replaces TRIPOD 2015.** It is not TRIPOD 2015 plus AI addenda — it is a
complete rewrite, applicable to prediction-model studies using **either** regression **or** machine-learning
methods. For any prediction-model study (regression or AI/ML), use this checklist; do **not** apply the 2015
checklist alongside it.

The checklist has **27 main items** and **52 checklist subitems**, in eight sections: Title (1), Abstract (2),
Introduction (3–4), Methods (5–17), Open science (18), Patient and public involvement (19), Results (20–24),
and Discussion (25–27).

**Applicability column:** `D` = relevant only to model **development**; `E` = relevant only to model
**evaluation**; `D;E` = applicable to **both**.

## MedSci supplemental checks — NOT official TRIPOD+AI items

The following are **not** TRIPOD+AI checklist items. They are engineering-reproducibility prompts this
toolkit adds because they matter for an AI/ML model to be rebuildable, and they extend (do not replace) the
official items noted. Assess them **only as supplements**; never report them as canonical TRIPOD+AI item
numbers, and never let them substitute for an official item.

| Supplemental check | Extends official item | What to look for |
|---|---|---|
| Model architecture | 12c | Network type, depth, layers, activation and loss functions — enough detail to rebuild the model. |
| Training configuration | 12c | Optimizer, learning-rate schedule, batch size, epochs, early-stopping criterion, regularisation. |
| Software and hardware | 18f, 22 | Libraries with version numbers, language, and the compute used (e.g., GPU type for deep learning). |
| Reproducibility | 18e, 18f | Random seeds, the exact data split, and whether code + weights are available to reproduce results. |

Official item **14 (Fairness)**, **18f (Code sharing)**, **22 (Model specification / API)**, and
**7 (Data preparation)** already cover fairness, code/model availability, and preprocessing — assess those
under their official items, not as extras here.

## Notes for assessors

- **Footnotes carried from the official checklist.** Item 12c is assessed **separately for every
  model-building approach** used, not once for the study. Item 18f (code sharing) refers to the
  *analysis* code — data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, evaluation — while item 22
  refers to the code needed to *implement* the model for a new individual; a study can satisfy one
  and not the other.

- **Applicability.** Mark items labelled `D` (development-only) or `E` (evaluation-only) as N/A when they do
  not apply to the study design; `D;E` items apply to both.
- **Open science (18a–18f) and PPI (19) are official, mandatory items** — a compliance report that skips them
  is incomplete. Data sharing (18e) and code sharing (18f) are where an AI/ML study's reproducibility is
  assessed.
- **Performance (23a) with confidence intervals is required**, including for key subgroups; heterogeneity
  across clusters (23b) when examined. A study reporting a point estimate without a CI is PARTIAL on 23a.
- **Fairness is an official item (14)** and is reported across demographic groups in 20b and 23a — not an
  optional AI add-on.
- Do **not** apply TRIPOD 2015 alongside this checklist; TRIPOD+AI 2024 supersedes it for both regression and
  AI/ML prediction models.
- For a study that is both a diagnostic-accuracy study and a prediction-model study, cross-reference STARD.
