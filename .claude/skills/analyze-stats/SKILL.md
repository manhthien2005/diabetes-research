# Statistical Analysis Skill

You are assisting a medical researcher with statistical analyses for medical research papers.
Generate reproducible code (Python preferred, R when necessary) that produces publication-ready
tables and figures following journal standards for medical imaging research.

## Data Privacy Check

Before reading any data file, check whether it might contain Protected Health Information (PHI):

1. If `*_deidentified.*` files exist in the working directory, use those preferentially.
2. If only raw CSV/Excel files exist (no `*_deidentified.*` counterpart), warn the user (ask in the user's preferred language):
   > "Does this data contain patient identifiers (names, national ID / RRN, contact details, etc.)?
   > If so, please de-identify it first with the `/deidentify` skill."
3. If the user confirms the data is already de-identified or contains no PHI, proceed.
4. **NEVER** display raw PHI values (names, phone numbers, RRN) in your output. If you
   encounter them while reading data, warn the user and suggest running `/deidentify`.

## Reference Files

- **Templates**: `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/templates/` -- reusable analysis scripts
- **Analysis guides**: `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/analysis_guides/` -- on-demand methodology references
- **Table standards**: `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/table-standards/` -- journal-specific table formatting
  - `table-standards.md` -- universal rules, AMA rules, footnote system, mistakes checklist
  - `journal-profiles/` -- YAML profiles per journal (radiology, jama, nejm, lancet, eur_rad, ajr)
  - `table-types/` -- templates per table type (Table 1, diagnostic accuracy, regression, survival/Cox, agreement/reliability, meta-analysis, model comparison, incremental value, reader study (MRMC))
  - `tool-comparison.md` -- R/Python tool comparison and recommended pipelines
- **Figure style**: `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/style/figure_style.mplstyle`
- **Project data**: See CLAUDE.md for data locations under `2_Data/`

Read relevant templates before generating analysis code. For complex analysis types
(regression, propensity score, repeated measures), also load the corresponding guide
from `analysis_guides/` to ensure correct methodology and reporting.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Data Assessment

1. **Read the data file** (CSV, Excel, TSV, or other tabular format).
2. **Report to the user**:
   - Shape (rows x columns)
   - Column names and inferred types (continuous, categorical, ordinal, binary, datetime)
   - Missing values per column (count and percentage)
   - First 5 rows preview
   - Unique value counts for categorical columns
3. **Identify the analysis unit**: patient, exam, lesion, image, rater, study, etc.

### Phase 2: Analysis Plan

**Precondition (observational studies).** Before proposing an analysis plan for an observational design (cohort, case-control, cross-sectional, registry, or survey), confirm that a literature-grounded variable operationalization exists — a `variable_operationalization.md` from `/define-variables`, or an equivalent codebook-backed definition table. If none exists, **warn** the user and recommend running `/define-variables` first, so exposure / outcome / covariate definitions and cutoffs are citation-backed rather than invented ad hoc from the data dictionary (ad-hoc phenotype/cutoff definitions are a common reviewer-rejection trigger for observational work — see the dictionary-first discipline). This is a WARN, not a hard block: proceed on explicit user confirmation, recording that the operationalization artifact was not available. For stricter projects, treat the missing artifact as a hard stop until `/define-variables` has run. (This mirrors the same precondition already enforced in `/write-protocol` before drafting Methods.)

Based on the data structure and research question, propose an analysis plan:

1. **Auto-detect analysis type** from the table below, or accept user specification.
2. **List specific tests** to be performed.
3. **Identify primary and secondary endpoints**.
4. **State assumptions** that will be checked (normality, homogeneity, independence).
5. **Note any data cleaning** needed (recoding, outlier handling, missing data strategy).
6. **Anchor the estimand to the research question.** If interaction/synergy/effect-modification is the question, the primary estimand is the **interaction parameter itself** (a likelihood-ratio test of the interaction term, or the interaction OR/HR on a single consistent scale) — not a main-effect OR whose CI is then read as "no synergy." If the claim is equivalence or non-inferiority, declare the margin up front (a TOST procedure, or the CI compared against a pre-stated MCID); a non-significant difference is not equivalence without a margin.

7. **Screen every categorical/binary predictor for separation — before fitting anything.**
   A predictor that perfectly predicts the outcome breaks maximum likelihood: no finite MLE
   exists. The failure is silent — `glm` does not error, it returns an odds ratio near 0 (or
   enormous), *p* ≈ 0.99, and an AUC that then gets written into a table. This is routine in
   diagnostic imaging, because the good signs are the pathognomonic ones (T2-FLAIR mismatch,
   the string sign, a halo sign): 100% specificity means an empty cell by construction.

   ```bash
   python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_separation.py" \
     --data cohort.csv --outcome idh_mutant --auto --strict
   ```

   `COMPLETE_SEPARATION` (an empty cell) and `QUASI_SEPARATION` (a cell below the sparsity
   floor) both halt the plan. The remedy is a **design** decision, not a numerical one:
   Firth's penalised likelihood keeps one model, while a **two-stage rule** — classify the
   sign-positive cases directly, model only the sign-negative remainder — is usually the
   clinically meaningful choice for a pathognomonic sign, because a sign-positive patient is
   already diagnosed and the real question is what to do with everyone else. Decide this in
   the plan; do not discover it in the output.

Present the plan and **wait for user approval** before executing.

For test selection guidance, load `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/analysis_guides/test_selection.md`.

### Phase 3: Execute

Generate and run a Python (preferred) or R script following these rules:

#### Script Structure

Every script MUST start with a reproducibility header:

```python
"""
Analysis: {description}
Date: {YYYY-MM-DD}
Random seed: 42
Python: {version}
Key packages: {package==version, ...}
"""
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
np.random.seed(42)
```

#### Execution Rules

1. **Random seed**: Always `np.random.seed(42)` or `set.seed(42)`.
2. **Figure style**: Always load the matplotlib style file:
   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   style_path = os.path.join(os.environ.get('CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR', '.'), 'references/style/figure_style.mplstyle')
   if os.path.exists(style_path):
       plt.style.use(style_path)
   ```
3. **Output files**: Save all outputs to the same directory as the input data, or to a
   user-specified output directory.
4. **Tables**: Save as CSV (for downstream use) AND print a formatted markdown/console version.
5. **Figures**: Save as both PDF (vector) and PNG (300 DPI).
6. **Console output**: Print a summary formatted for direct copy-paste into a Results section.

#### Assumption Checking

Before running parametric tests, always check and report:

- **Normality**: Shapiro-Wilk test (n < 50) or Kolmogorov-Smirnov (n >= 50), plus visual QQ plot
- **Homogeneity of variance**: Levene's test
- **If assumptions violated**: Use non-parametric alternatives and report why

#### Multiple Comparisons

- If running 3+ tests on the same dataset, apply Bonferroni or Benjamini-Hochberg correction.
- Always report both uncorrected and corrected p-values.
- State the correction method used.

#### Stratified & Ordinal-Trend Reporting

- **Strata disjointness gate (before any ordinal trend test).** Before running a Cochran-Armitage trend test (or any analysis that treats tiers as an ordered partition), assert the strata are mutually exclusive and exhaustive: `sum(n per stratum) == unique N` and `sum(events per stratum) == total events`. A trend test on overlapping or non-exhaustive strata is invalid. Emit the per-stratum N/event table and the reconciliation in the output (this is the analysis-side mirror of `/self-review` `check_cohort_arithmetic.py` `PARTITION_OVERLAP`).
- **Secondary stratum-HR validation checklist.** Every secondary stratum hazard/odds ratio must be reported with (a) its **reference contrast** (which category is the referent), (b) the **event count** in each stratum, and (c) a **sparse-stratum caveat** when any stratum has a low event count (a rule of thumb: < 10 events makes the estimate unstable). A bare "HR 1.55 in lean participants" without the referent and the events is uninterpretable.
- **Proportion CI lower-bound clamp.** Clamp every proportion confidence-interval lower bound to `max(0, lower)`; a zero-event Wilson/score interval can emit a negative or absurd tiny-exponent lower bound (e.g., `3.47e-16`) that is a display artifact, not a real bound. Report `0` (or `0.0%`) instead, and prefer an exact (Clopper-Pearson) interval for zero/near-zero cells.

#### Output Manifest

After all analyses complete, save `_analysis_outputs.md` in the output directory.
Use the [output format and bound binary workflow](references/analysis_run_workflow.md)
when producing the analysis outputs.

This manifest enables downstream skills (`/make-figures`, `/write-paper`) to auto-discover analysis outputs without user intervention.

For **prespecified binary predictions on independent units**, use the bundled
`scripts/run_analysis.py run` workflow described in
[`references/analysis_run_workflow.md`](references/analysis_run_workflow.md).
It executes the existing diagnostic template and embeds data/configuration/code/
output hashes, exact counts, metric-specific denominators and the reproduction
command in this same manifest. `audit` checks recorded versions without rewriting
them; `compare` separates declared context and recorded numeric equality from byte
drift. It does not select thresholds or establish study validity, privacy clearance
or reuse rights. The original synthetic example runs with
`python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/demo_analysis_run.py --out demo-project`.

### Phase 3.5: Generated-Code Quality Gate

Before reporting any script as final, lint every emitted `.py`/`.R` file for the
reproducibility-hygiene "slop" that AI-generated analysis code recurrently carries:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_generated_code.py {script.py} --strict
# or scan a whole output directory:
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_generated_code.py --code-dir {analysis_dir} --strict
```

**Major findings (fix before reporting the script):**
- `MISSING_SEED` — randomness used (sampling, bootstrap, train/test split, rng) with no
  `np.random.seed` / `set.seed` / `random_state=` / `default_rng`. Non-reproducible.
- `HARDCODED_DATA_LITERAL` — a hand-typed, table-shaped numeric literal instead of
  `read_csv()`/`read.csv()` + subset. This is the data-integrity rule "never hand-type CSV
  data into scripts."
- `HARDCODED_ABS_PATH` — an absolute path literal (`/Users/`, `/home/`, `C:\`, `~/Documents`).
  Non-portable and a PII risk.
- `INPLACE_SOURCE_OVERWRITE` — writing to the same path read as input; this overwrites raw
  data. Write derived outputs to a new path ("never modify raw data").

**Flags (fix when tidying):** `DEBUG_LEFTOVER` (a `breakpoint()` / `browser()` / debug print
/ TODO marker left in) and `UNUSED_IMPORT` (a dead Python dependency).

The gate is conservative on the Major checks — it fires `HARDCODED_DATA_LITERAL` only on
genuinely table-shaped literals and `MISSING_SEED` only on a real randomness call — so it
stays quiet on legitimate analysis code. It is the analysis-side mirror of the
data-integrity and reproducibility checks `/self-review` is built to catch downstream.

### Phase 4: Report

After execution, generate manuscript-ready text:

1. **Results paragraph**: 3-8 sentences with specific numbers, formatted as:
   - Continuous: "mean +/- SD" or "median (IQR)"
   - Proportions: "n/N (XX.X%)"
   - Test results: "statistic = X.XX, p = 0.XXX"
   - Effect sizes: "Cohen's d = X.XX (95% CI: X.XX-X.XX)"
   - AUC: "AUC = 0.XXX (95% CI: 0.XXX-0.XXX)"
2. **Table/figure captions**: Draft captions referencing table/figure numbers.
3. **Methods snippet**: 2-3 sentences describing the statistical methods used, suitable for
   the Methods section.

## Statistical Reporting Rules (Always Enforced)

These rules apply to ALL analyses without exception:

1. **Exact p-values**: Report exact values (e.g., p = 0.034), not inequalities.
   Exception: report as p < 0.001 when the value is below 0.001.
2. **Confidence intervals**: Always report 95% CIs for primary endpoints.
3. **Effect sizes**: Report alongside every p-value (Cohen's d, eta-squared, odds ratio,
   risk ratio, etc., as appropriate).
4. **Parametric vs non-parametric**: Choose based on assumption checks, not convenience.
   Report the assumption test results.
5. **Multiple comparisons**: Apply and explicitly report the correction method when
   performing 3+ comparisons.
6. **Sample size reporting**: Always state n for each group/analysis.
7. **Missing data**: Report how many cases were excluded and why.
8. **Decimal places**: p-values to 3 decimals, proportions to 1 decimal, means/SDs to
   appropriate precision for the measurement.
9. **Design/power statistics are code outputs, never hand-computed.** Any minimum detectable
   effect (MDE), a-priori or post-hoc power, or required sample size that will appear in the
   manuscript MUST be emitted by this committed script — printed with its method and inputs
   (n per arm, alpha, power, allocation ratio, one/two-sided) — not computed in a side tool
   (G*Power, an online calculator) and pasted in. Use one method family consistently
   (e.g. the exact noncentral-t via `statsmodels` `TTestIndPower` or `scipy`'s `nct`); do not
   mix a normal approximation for some values with exact-t for others. A value that exists only
   in the manuscript with no script that reproduces it is the failure mode `/self-review`
   Phase 2.5a-2 is built to catch.
10. **Estimand & CI output contract.** Every primary point estimate — including quantile
    estimands (T25, median time-to-event), pooled proportions, and subdistribution HRs, not
    just ORs/HRs/AUCs — MUST be emitted together with its 95% CI. In the output CSV, carry the
    interval as explicit columns (`estimate, ci_lower, ci_upper`) or as a single text column in
    `est (lo–hi)` form; never emit a point estimate with no interval in an adjacent column.
    Round ORs/HRs/sHRs to 2 decimals and AUC/C-statistic to 3. This is the output side of the
    `/self-review` §C assertion that "all primary metrics have 95% CIs."

### Effect-Size Real-World Translation

Whenever a primary result is a correlation, a standardized coefficient, a regression slope, an
OR/HR/RR, or a Cohen's d, also report it as a **plain-language unit shift** a non-statistician can
act on. The coefficient answers "is there an association"; the translation answers "how much, in
units I use". This complements rule 3 above (report effect sizes) — it does not replace it.

**When to apply**
- Any continuous-exposure to continuous-outcome association reported as Spearman's rho, Pearson's r,
  or a standardized slope.
- Any OR/HR/RR where the audience needs an absolute-risk feel.
- Reader / expert-elicitation studies, clinical-utility framing, abstracts, and figure captions.

**Procedure**
1. **Pick an anchored contrast on the exposure**, not a 1-unit step. Default: 25th to 75th percentile
   (IQR). State both endpoints in native units.
2. **Translate to the outcome scale.**
   - For a rank/standardized association (Spearman's rho or a per-SD slope) under an approximately
     monotonic-linear assumption:
     `delta_outcome ~= ((x_p75 - x_p25) / SD_x) * |rho| * SD_outcome`.
     Report as: "going from {x_p25} to {x_p75} {units} is associated with about {delta_outcome}
     {outcome units} on average."
   - For a regression slope b: `delta_outcome = b * (x_p75 - x_p25)` (cleaner; no monotonicity caveat).
   - State the assumption explicitly; the IQR translation is a more defensible verbal guide than an
     SD-scaled one.
3. **For OR/HR/RR**, accompany the relative measure with an absolute one at a stated baseline risk:
   the absolute risk difference, and NNT = 1 / ARR (or NNH = 1 / ARI). Always state the baseline risk used.
4. **Bound the claim**: report the contrast, the assumption, and a CI on the coefficient; do not imply
   causation from a crude or unadjusted estimate.

**Worked example (synthetic)**
rho = 0.39 between a fasting marker (IQR 0.6 to 3.5 units, SD 3.05) and an index (SD 2.13):
`((3.5 - 0.6) / 3.05) * 0.39 * 2.13 ~= 0.8` -> "Going from the 25th to the 75th percentile of the
marker is associated with about 0.8 index units higher on average (monotonic-linear approximation;
crude, unadjusted)."

**Output contract (clinical-utility is a default, not an optional add-on).** Report every
primary effect in units a clinician acts on, by default — do not leave these as prose to be
added later:
- **OR/HR/RR primary outcomes** → report the relative measure **and** the absolute risk at
  a stated baseline + absolute risk difference + **NNT** (or NNH = 1/ARI), baseline risk
  explicit. A relative-only headline is incomplete.
- **Continuous outcomes** → add the IQR/clinically-anchored "Real-world translation" line
  beneath the effect size.
- **Prediction / classification (incl. medical-AI) models** → a **decision-curve /
  net-benefit** pass at the relevant threshold is standard output, not just AUC +
  calibration. An incremental claim reports added **net benefit / NRI / IDI over the
  established clinical model**, not the new model's AUC alone. See
  `references/table-standards/table-types/incremental_value.md` and the `make-figures`
  `decision_curve` exemplar (and `render_core_figures.py` for the rendered curve).

## Error Handling

- If a script fails to execute, report the error in one line, diagnose the likely cause
  (missing package, data format mismatch, wrong column name), and present a fix.
- Do NOT retry the same script more than once without modifying it or asking the user.
- If an R package is unavailable, suggest `install.packages()` and wait for user confirmation.
- For prediction models: always include calibration assessment (Brier score, calibration plot,
  or calibration slope/intercept) alongside discrimination metrics. AUC alone is insufficient.

## Output Conventions

### Tables

**Before generating any publication table**, load the journal profile and table type template:
1. Load `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/table-standards/journal-profiles/{journal}.yaml` if a target journal is known
2. Load `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/table-standards/table-types/{type}.md` for the relevant table type
3. If no journal specified, default to AMA style (Radiology profile)

**Output formats** (always generate all three):
- CSV file (for downstream use and archival)
- Console markdown rendering (for user review)
- R gtsummary code (for publication-quality Word/LaTeX export)

**Universal rules** (enforced regardless of journal):
- No vertical lines — horizontal rules only (top, below header, bottom)
- Binary variables: show only one level (e.g., Male only, not Male + Female)
- Units in column headers, not repeated in cells
- Consistent decimal places within each column
- All abbreviations defined in footnotes, self-contained per table
- Exact P values always (never "NS" or "significant")
- Name the statistical test in footnote or general note
- Variability measure always stated: mean (SD) or median (IQR)

**Journal-specific parameters** (from loaded YAML profile):
- Footnote markers: letters (AMA) vs symbols (NEJM/Lancet)
- P value format: case, leading zero, italic
- CI separator: comma (Radiology) vs "to" (JAMA/NEJM/Lancet)
- Title format: period (AMA) vs colon (Lancet)
- Abbreviation order: appearance (Radiology) vs alphabetical (JAMA)

**Footnote placement order** (universal):
1. General note (no marker) — e.g., "Data are mean (SD) unless noted"
2. Abbreviations — in order per journal convention
3. Specific notes (superscript markers) — per-cell explanations
4. Probability notes — significance thresholds (if applicable)

**gtsummary pipeline** (recommended for R table generation):
```r
theme_gtsummary_journal("{journal}")  # "jama", "lancet", "nejm"
theme_gtsummary_compact()
# ... build table ...
tbl %>% as_flex_table() %>% flextable::save_as_docx(path = "table.docx")
```

**Validation checklist** (run before finalizing any table):
- [ ] Binary variables show only one level
- [ ] Units in headers, not cells
- [ ] Consistent decimal places per column
- [ ] Statistical test named (footnote or general note)
- [ ] Effect sizes per clinically meaningful unit (per 10 years, not per 1 year)
- [ ] Reference category stated for categorical predictors
- [ ] No "NS" — exact P values only
- [ ] Abbreviations defined in footnotes

### Figures

- Format: PDF (vector, for journal) + PNG (300 DPI, for review)
- Style: Use `figure_style.mplstyle` for consistent appearance
- Font: Arial, 8-10pt
- Colors: Colorblind-safe palette
- Size: 3.5 inches (single column) or 7.0 inches (double column) width
- Always include axis labels with units

### Console Output

- Formatted for direct copy-paste into the Results section of a manuscript
- Include all numbers that would appear in the text
- Use the reporting format conventions above

## Analysis-Specific Guidelines

### Table 1 (Demographics)

- Template: `references/templates/table1_demographics.py`
- Table type guide: `references/table-standards/table-types/table1_demographics.md`
- Continuous variables: mean +/- SD if normal, median (IQR) if skewed
- Categorical variables: n (%)
- Binary variables: show only one level (e.g., Male n (%), not both Male and Female)
- Compare groups: t-test/Mann-Whitney for continuous, chi-square/Fisher for categorical
- Report standardized mean differences (SMD) if requested (preferred over P for PS-matched studies)
- RCTs: P values in Table 1 are usually unnecessary per CONSORT
- gtsummary `tbl_summary()` with journal theme for R pipeline

### Diagnostic Accuracy

- **Methodology guide**: `references/analysis_guides/diagnostic_accuracy.md` (**load before generating code** — every metric with a CI on a stated analysis unit; the confidence-weighted trap [unweighted-baseline AUC + monotonic-encoding check, produce-side of probe D9]; paired DeLong vs MRMC for reader-generalising claims; per-stratum admissibility [D10]; one-scale-per-comparison [D11])
- Template: `references/templates/diagnostic_accuracy.py`
- Always report: sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, accuracy, AUC
- CIs: Wilson score for proportions, DeLong for AUC
- ROC curve: include diagonal reference line, AUC in legend
- If comparing models: DeLong test for AUC comparison
- Youden's index for optimal threshold when applicable
- Include calibration assessment (Brier score, calibration plot) for prediction models
- **NRI/IDI**: When comparing two models (e.g., base model vs model + AI score), report:
  - Category-based NRI (with clinically defined risk categories)
  - Continuous NRI (note: tends to be inflated — report alongside category-based)
  - IDI (Integrated Discrimination Improvement)
  - Bootstrap 95% CIs (1000+ iterations)
  - These supplement, not replace, DeLong AUC comparison
- Table type guide (added value beyond a baseline): `references/table-standards/table-types/incremental_value.md` (paired ΔAUC + DeLong CI, continuous NRI with event/non-event split, IDI, net benefit at a prespecified threshold, same-patient/calibrated-first discipline). Pairs the decision-curve exemplar `make-figures` `references/exemplar_plots/decision_curve.md`.
- Reader study (MRMC): `references/table-standards/table-types/reader_study.md` (per-reader + reader-averaged AUC with an Obuchowski–Rockette/DBM reader+case CI, per-patient vs per-lesion unit, superiority vs non-inferiority margin). Use an MRMC method (not a fixed-reader DeLong CI) for a claim that generalises to readers. Pairs `make-figures` `references/exemplar_plots/mrmc_roc.md`.

### Inter-rater Agreement

- **Methodology guide**: `references/analysis_guides/agreement_reliability.md` (**load before generating code** — the pseudoreplication trap for clustered/repeated measurements + the pseudoreplication-safe per-subject / mixed-effects code, ICC model/type selection, agreement-vs-reliability distinction; pairs with self-review probe O18)
- Table type guide: `references/table-standards/table-types/agreement.md` (ICC with model/type + CI, weighted κ for ordinal, Bland–Altman bias + LoA, reliability-vs-agreement distinction, common errors)
- Template: `references/templates/agreement_analysis.py`
- 2 raters + categorical: Cohen's kappa
- 2+ raters + categorical: Fleiss' kappa (or Krippendorff's alpha)
- Continuous: ICC (specify model: one-way, two-way random/mixed; type: single/average)
- Always report interpretation labels (Landis & Koch or Cicchetti)
- Bland-Altman plot for continuous paired measurements
- Bootstrap CIs (1000 iterations, seed=42)

### Meta-analysis

- Prefer R (meta/metafor packages) for meta-analysis
- **Comparative**: `metabin()` for binary outcomes (OR/RR), `metagen()` for continuous
  - Use `method = "Inverse"`, `method.tau = "DL"`, `method.random.ci = "HK"`
  - Avoid deprecated args: `comb.fixed` → `common`, `hakn` → `method.random.ci`
- **Single-arm pooled proportion**: `metaprop()` with `sm = "PLOGIT"`, `method.ci = "CP"`
  - **Small-study test branch**: do **not** use Egger's regression for a single-arm proportion meta-analysis — funnel-asymmetry tests assume an effect-size-vs-SE relationship that does not hold for raw proportions. If a small-study assessment is needed, use Peters' test or an arcsine-based variant, and only when `k >= 10` (note underpowered otherwise)
  - **Standard output**: report `tau-squared` on the logit scale and a **95% prediction interval** (`metaprop(..., prediction = TRUE)`) in addition to the pooled estimate; the PI conveys where a future study's proportion is expected to fall under the random-effects model
- **Nested observation units**: if the proportion's unit is nested within study (e.g., per-lesion within study, per-image within patient), do **not** report a naive Wilson/binomial CI that ignores clustering — use a cluster-bootstrap or a GLMM with a random intercept per study so the CI reflects the design
- Heterogeneity: I-squared, Q test, tau-squared, and a 95% prediction interval for the random-effects pooled estimate
- Forest plot: individual studies + pooled estimate
- Funnel plot + Egger's test for publication bias (comparative effect sizes only; note: underpowered k<10)
- Sensitivity analysis: leave-one-out (`metainf()`)
- Subgroup: `update(res, subgroup = variable)`

### DTA Meta-Analysis

- Template: `references/templates/dta_meta_analysis.R`
- Prefer R (`mada`, `meta`, `metafor` packages) for DTA meta-analysis
- **Bivariate model** (Reitsma): `mada::reitsma()` — recommended over separate pooling of Se/Sp
  - Accounts for correlation between sensitivity and specificity
  - Produces SROC curve with confidence + prediction regions
- **Key outputs**: Pooled Se/Sp (95% CI), positive/negative LR, DOR, SROC AUC
- **Threshold effect**: Spearman correlation between logit(Se) and logit(FPR)
  - If significant: interpret single pooled Se/Sp with caution, emphasize SROC curve
- **Forest plots**: Paired (sensitivity + specificity side by side)
- **Publication bias**: Deeks' funnel plot asymmetry test (NOT standard funnel plot)
  - Standard funnel plots are inappropriate for DTA studies
  - Note: underpowered for k < 10
- **Dual approach** (comparative + single-arm):
  - Primary: `metabin()` for comparative studies (OR/RR)
  - Secondary: `metaprop()` with `sm = "PLOGIT"` for single-arm pooled proportion
  - Use `method = "Inverse"`, `method.tau = "DL"`, `method.random.ci = "HK"`
- **Small studies (k < 10)**: bivariate model may not converge; consider narrative synthesis
- **Alternative**: If `mada` unavailable, use `metafor::rma.mv()` with bivariate structure

### Network Meta-Analysis

- **Guide**: Load `analysis_guides/network_meta_analysis.md` before generating code
- For ≥3 interventions via combined direct + indirect evidence (incl. component NMA); pairwise machinery (search/screening/random-effects model) via the Meta-analysis section above
- **Assess transitivity before pooling**: compare effect-modifier distributions across comparisons (box plots / table) and/or network meta-regression — it is a clinical judgment, not a test
- **Test consistency** globally (design-by-treatment) AND locally (node-split / back-calculation); a **star network (no closed loops) cannot be checked** — state it; investigate the source of any inconsistency (often one trial)
- R `netmeta` (frequentist: `netsplit`, `decomp.design`, `netheat`, `netrank` P-scores, comparison-adjusted `funnel`) or Bayesian `gemtc` / `multinma` / `BUGSnet` (node-split, SUCRA, DIC)
- Present a **network plot** (node ∝ sample size, edge ∝ #trials); report global **τ²**; **ranking (SUCRA/P-score) is not a superiority test** — report it with the league table, intervals, and certainty
- Certainty **per estimate** via **CINeMA / GRADE-NMA** (downgrade indirect-only); component NMA assumes **additivity** (state/check it). Report against **PRISMA-NMA**; risk of bias via **RoB-NMA**. Review-side probes: NM1–NM8 in `network_meta_analysis.md`

### Health Economic Evaluation

- **Guide**: Load `analysis_guides/health_economic_evaluation.md` before generating code
- For cost-effectiveness (CEA), cost-utility (CUA, QALY), cost-benefit (CBA), cost-minimisation, or budget-impact analyses; trial-based or decision-model-based (decision tree, **Markov/state-transition**, discrete-event simulation)
- Compute **incremental cost ΔC, incremental effect ΔE, and the ICER = ΔC/ΔE**; with ≥3 options remove **dominated / extended-dominated** strategies before sequential ICERs; prefer **net benefit (INMB = λΔE − ΔC)** for regression/probabilistic summaries
- State and justify the **perspective, time horizon (lifetime for chronic disease), discount rate (both costs and outcomes), currency + price year**; QALYs from a named preference-based instrument + value set
- **Uncertainty is the analytic core**: one-way / **tornado** for drivers, **probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA)** with justified parameter distributions (beta for probabilities/utilities, gamma/log-normal for costs) → **cost-effectiveness plane + CEAC**; scenario analyses for structural choices
- R `heemod` / `dampack` / `hesim` / `BCEA` (state-transition + PSA + CEAC + EVPI), `flexsurv` for survival extrapolation. Report against **CHEERS 2022**; make the "cost-effective" conclusion conditional on a stated willingness-to-pay threshold. Review-side probes: HE1–HE8 in `health_economic_evaluation.md`

### Survey/Likert

- Descriptive: median, IQR, frequency distribution per item
- Internal consistency: Cronbach's alpha with item-total correlations
- **Reverse-coding guard (run before reliability)**: a negatively-worded scale item must be recoded `(min+max) - x` before computing the scale total or Cronbach's alpha. An un-recoded reverse item produces a *negative* item-rest correlation and a negative alpha — which is a coding bug, **not** evidence of a multidimensional construct (do not defend it as such; you lose a review round). `likert_summary.py` prints the per-item item-rest correlations, flags negative ones as reverse-code suspects, warns loudly on a negative alpha, and accepts `--reverse-items E3 ...` to apply the recode before scoring. To screen at cleaning time, run `/clean-data` `scripts/check_reverse_coding.py`. See the global rule `survey-scale-reliability.md`.
- If comparing groups: Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis (ordinal data)
- Visualization: diverging stacked bar chart

### Survival Analysis

- **Methodology guide**: `references/analysis_guides/survival.md` (**load before generating code** — competing risks first [naive 1−KM overestimates → produce the Aalen–Johansen/Fine–Gray CIF; cause-specific vs subdistribution for which question, produce-side of probe S3]; PH check → RMST when violated; reverse-KM follow-up + C-index variant [S6]; estimand provenance [S8])
- Table type guide: `references/table-standards/table-types/survival_results.md` (Cox results table: events/person-time, reverse-KM median follow-up, univariable + adjusted HR with CI, PH-assumption footnote, EPV/sparse-stratum and RMST-when-PH-violated rules)
- Kaplan-Meier curves with number-at-risk table
- Log-rank test for group comparison
- Cox proportional hazards: report HR (95% CI)
- **Events-per-variable (EPV) gate**: check `events / n_covariates >= 10` before fitting Cox (mirror of the logistic EPV rule). Warn if violated and fall back to a Firth/penalized Cox or profile-likelihood CIs; do not report Wald CIs from a sparse-event model as if stable
- **Nested observation units (cluster-robust CI)**: when a subject contributes more than one analysed unit (multiple lesions, both eyes, repeated episodes), pass a subject id so the HR CIs use a robust cluster-sandwich variance (`coxph(..., cluster = id)` / `robust = TRUE` in R, `cluster_col=` in lifelines, e.g. `survival_analysis.py --cluster <id>`). Treating correlated rows as independent understates the standard errors and narrows the CI artificially
- Check proportional hazards assumption (Schoenfeld residuals)
- **PH violation → do not report a single time-averaged HR.** If the Schoenfeld global test is significant (or a covariate's residual trends with time), a single Cox HR averages a changing effect and is misleading. Report a piecewise / time-stratified HR (split follow-up at a clinically sensible cut, or `tt()` time-transform), or switch to RMST difference at a fixed horizon, and state the violation explicitly
- **Horizon vs follow-up.** Do not read a KM/CIF estimate at a horizon beyond the data: if a reported time point (e.g., a 15-year cumulative incidence) exceeds the reverse-KM median follow-up, either restrict the horizon to where the risk set is non-trivial or report the number-at-risk at that horizon so the reader can judge the extrapolation
- Report median survival with 95% CI
- **Warranty period / quantile estimands (T25 etc.)**: Time to a fixed cumulative incidence. Use `quantile()` from the KM/`survfit` object and **always emit the 95% CI** (the lower/upper from `quantile(km, conf.int=TRUE)`, or a log-transformed / bootstrap CI) alongside the events/n that define it. A quantile point estimate reported without its CI is incomplete. If the event rate is below the target quantile, report "not reached" and consider Weibull parametric extrapolation (also with an interval)

### Interval-Censored Survival

When exact event times are unknown (e.g., health screening cohorts where status changes are detected at periodic visits), standard KM underestimates time-to-event. Use interval-censored methods:

- **R packages**: `icenReg` (parametric/semi-parametric IC regression), `interval` (NPMLE/Turnbull), `survival` (Surv type "interval2")
- **Turnbull estimator**: Non-parametric MLE for interval-censored data — analogous to KM but accounts for the interval between last negative and first positive observation
- **Parametric IC models**: Weibull or log-logistic via `icenReg::ic_par()`. Report shape/scale parameters and compare AIC across distributions
- **Mid-point imputation**: Simple approximation — event time = midpoint of (last negative, first positive). Acceptable as sensitivity analysis but NOT as primary method
- **When to use**: Serial measurement cohorts (e.g., health screening databases), cancer screening intervals, repeated biomarker assessments
- **Auto-trigger**: if the event date is defined by a periodic visit / scheduled re-examination (the event is detected *at* a visit, not observed exactly), interval-censoring is not optional — make an IC model the **primary** analysis, or at minimum a mandatory pre-specified sensitivity analysis, and do not present a right-censored Cox `coxph()` on visit-dated events as if the times were exact
- **Multistate / transition models**: for repeated transitions (e.g., `msm`), account for subject-level clustering with a subject random effect or a sandwich (robust) variance, and check the time-homogeneity assumption (constant transition intensities) before trusting a single rate
- **Reporting**: State the interval-censored nature of the data explicitly in Methods. Report both standard KM (for comparability with prior literature) and IC estimates (as primary or sensitivity)

### Competing Risks

When death or other events preclude the outcome of interest, standard KM overestimates cumulative incidence (treats competing events as censored). Use competing risk methods:

- **R packages**: `cmprsk` (Fine-Gray), `tidycmprsk` (tidy interface), `survival` (cause-specific Cox)
- **Cumulative incidence function (CIF)**: `cmprsk::cuminc()` — replaces 1-KM for each event type. Gray's test for group comparison
- **Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard**: `cmprsk::crr()` or `tidycmprsk::crr()` — reports subdistribution HR (sHR) with 95% CI. Interpretable as effect on CIF directly. **Check the subdistribution-PH assumption** the same way you check it for Cox (a time-interaction term on the subdistribution scale, or inspection of scaled-residual analogues); a constant sHR is an assumption, not a given. Report the cause-specific HR alongside it so the etiologic and prognostic readings are both visible
- **Cause-specific Cox**: Standard Cox censoring competing events — reports cause-specific HR. Better for etiology; Fine-Gray better for prognosis/prediction
- **When to use**: Mortality studies with multiple causes of death, cardiovascular events when non-CV death is frequent, any outcome where competing events are common (>5% of total events)
- **Reporting**: Present CIF plots (NOT 1-KM) when competing risks exist. Report both cause-specific HR and subdistribution HR when the research question is etiologic. State which competing events were defined. When a CIF is quoted at a horizon beyond the median follow-up, report the number-at-risk at that horizon (or restrict the horizon) — a CIF extrapolated past the data is not a stable estimate

### Group Comparison

- 2 independent groups: t-test or Mann-Whitney U
- 2 paired groups: paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank
- 3+ independent groups: ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis, with post-hoc
- 3+ paired groups: repeated measures ANOVA or Friedman, with post-hoc
- Always report: test statistic, degrees of freedom, p-value, effect size

### Correlation

- Pearson r (if bivariate normal) or Spearman rho (if not)
- Report: coefficient, 95% CI, p-value
- Scatter plot with regression line and CI band
- For multiple variables: correlation matrix heatmap

### Logistic Regression

- **Guide**: Load `analysis_guides/regression.md` before generating code
- **Template**: `references/templates/regression.py` (set `regression_type = "logistic"`)
- Run univariable analysis first, then multivariable with clinically selected variables
- Required outputs: OR table (univariable + multivariable), C-statistic (95% CI), and **calibration** (intercept + slope + flexible plot — **not** Hosmer–Lemeshow, which is deprecated; see the calibration guide)
- **Prediction-model calibration guide**: `references/analysis_guides/calibration.md` (**load before generating code** for any model that outputs a risk used for a decision — the apparent slope of exactly 1.00 is the in-sample tell, so produce the **bootstrap optimism-corrected** slope/intercept; Van Calster's calibration levels; scaled Brier; why Hosmer–Lemeshow is dropped; produce-side of probe S7)
- Check VIF < 5, EPV >= 10 (warn if violated)
- **Nested observation units**: when rows are clustered within subjects (multiple lesions/visits per patient), use cluster-robust standard errors (`cov_type="cluster"`, `cov_kwds={"groups": id}` in statsmodels) or a mixed-effects logistic model — a naive logit CI assumes independent rows and is too narrow
- Box-Tidwell test for continuous predictor linearity
- Forest plot of adjusted ORs
- NRI/IDI if comparing models (incremental value assessment)

### Linear Regression

- **Guide**: Load `analysis_guides/regression.md` before generating code
- **Template**: `references/templates/regression.py` (set `regression_type = "linear"`)
- Required outputs: coefficient table (β, 95% CI, P), R²/adjusted R², VIF
- Always generate 4-panel diagnostic plot (residuals vs fitted, Q-Q, scale-location, leverage)
- Check assumptions: normality of residuals, homoscedasticity, multicollinearity
- Report both unstandardized β (primary) and standardized β (for effect size comparison)

### Propensity Score

- **Guide**: Load `analysis_guides/propensity_score.md` before generating code
- **Template**: `references/templates/propensity_score.py`
- Step 1: PS estimation (logistic regression)
- Step 2: Apply method (matching with caliper = 0.2 × SD logit PS, IPTW/SIPTW with stabilized weights, or overlap weighting)
- Step 3: Balance assessment — SMD < 0.10 for all covariates, Love plot mandatory
- Step 4: Weighted/matched outcome analysis with robust SE
- Step 5: Sensitivity analysis (E-value for unmeasured confounding)
- Always state the estimand (ATE/ATT/ATO) explicitly
- Recommend overlap weighting as default (no extreme weight issues)
- **SIPTW**: Stabilized IPTW variant used in emulated target trial frameworks; report effective sample size

### Survey-Weighted Analysis

- **Guide**: Load `analysis_guides/survey_weighted.md` before generating code
- **Template**: `references/templates/survey_weighted_analysis.py`
- For KNHANES/NHANES/KCHS and similar complex survey designs
- Always declare survey design (strata, cluster/PSU, weight) before analysis
- Use correct weight variable (interview vs exam vs nutrition)
- R `survey` package strongly recommended over Python for publication
- Sequential model building: Model 1 (age+sex) → Model 2 (full adjustment)
- Report weighted odds ratios (wOR) with 95% CI
- Cross-national: analyze each country separately, never pool
- Subgroup analysis: exclude the stratification variable from covariates

### Mediation Analysis

- **Guide**: Load `analysis_guides/mediation.md` before generating code
- Bootstrapped product-of-coefficients (a×b) indirect effect (R `mediation` / `CMAverse` / PROCESS); ≥2000 resamples, bias-corrected percentile CI — not the Sobel test
- **Binary outcome**: counterfactual / natural-effects decomposition (`CMAverse`, `regmedint`), not the naive OR product
- Report total, direct, indirect effects each with a bootstrap CI; **proportion mediated only with uncertainty and only when the total effect is well-estimated** (unstable / can exceed 100% when total is near-null)
- **Identification, not the bootstrap, is the issue**: mediation needs no unmeasured mediator–outcome confounding (sequential ignorability) → report an **E-value for the indirect effect** (or ρ-based sensitivity). A cross-sectional design cannot order X→M→Y — frame as association-level (review probe O13)
- Report against **AGReMA**

### Interaction & Effect Modification

- **Choose and state the scale.** A public-health / biological **synergy** claim is an **additive**-scale statement → report **RERI**, **AP** (attributable proportion), or **S** (synergy index), each **with a CI** — not only a multiplicative OR/HR product term. A non-significant multiplicative interaction is compatible with a large additive one (and vice versa)
- **"Joint association" via a combined multi-level exposure** (high/high vs low/low) shows joint *categories*, not interaction — add the product term (multiplicative) and/or RERI (additive) to claim interaction
- **Stratified-only** "stronger in A than B" is the difference-in-significance fallacy — report the formal interaction term, not two separate stratum estimates
- R `interactionR` / `epiR` for RERI/AP/S with CIs; follow Knol & VanderWeele interaction-reporting recommendations. Review-side probe: O14 in `observational_confounding.md`

### Multiple Testing & High-Dimensional Screening

- **Guide**: Load `analysis_guides/multiplicity.md` before generating code
- For agnostic many-exposure scans (ExWAS / EWAS / MWAS / proteome-/nutrient-wide) and any "screen N predictors, report the significant ones" pass
- **Match the correction to the claim**: FWER (Bonferroni / Holm / permutation-based study-wide threshold) for a confirmatory single hit; FDR (Benjamini–Hochberg q-value) for discovery — then frame as hypothesis-generating
- Report the correction method **and the number of tests `m`** (the denominator), applied to the whole tested set — never shrink `m` to the winners
- **Replication is the real safeguard**: split-half / second cohort / cross-cycle with directional concordance and a reported replication rate; a single-cohort FDR-significant scan is exploratory
- Correlated exposures → raw Bonferroni is over-conservative (permutation or effective-number-of-tests via `poolr::meff()`); a univariate hit may be a marker for a correlated cause (consider WQS / quantile g-computation / BKMR before causal reading)
- Report full results (all effect sizes + p/q), not only winners; complex surveys combine design-based SEs (`survey_weighted.md`) WITH the correction. Review-side probe: O17 in `observational_confounding.md`

### Mendelian Randomization

- **Guide**: Load `analysis_guides/mendelian_randomization.md` before generating code
- For genetic-instrument causal inference: two-sample summary-data MR, one-sample MR, MVMR, drug-target / cis-MR, non-linear MR
- **State and evidence the 3 IV assumptions**: relevance (F-statistic / R²), independence (ancestry + confounder scan), exclusion restriction (no horizontal pleiotropy — the untestable one)
- **Pre-specify the full sensitivity suite, not IVW alone**: IVW + MR-Egger (intercept = directional pleiotropy) + weighted median + weighted mode + MR-PRESSO; Cochran's Q + leave-one-out; concordance across methods is the robustness claim (R `TwoSampleMR` / `MendelianRandomization`)
- Address **reverse causation** (Steiger / bidirectional), **sample overlap** (report fraction; overlap + weak instruments inflate type-1 error), **winner's curse** (select instruments in an independent GWAS), and ancestry matching
- **Drug-target / cis-MR**: GLS-IVW for correlated cis variants + colocalization (`coloc`) + positive control + adverse-effect phenome scan. **Non-linear MR**: residual/doubly-ranked shapes can be artefactual → require negative/positive controls + extreme-stratum sensitivity
- Interpret as a **lifelong genetic-proxy effect direction**, not a clinical-intervention magnitude; report against **STROBE-MR**. Review-side probes: MR1–MR8 in `mendelian_randomization.md`

### Polygenic Risk Score (PRS / PGS)

- **Guide**: Load `analysis_guides/polygenic_risk_score.md` before generating code
- For developing/validating/applying a genome-wide polygenic score as a predictor or risk-stratifier (distinct from MR: PRS is prediction, MR is causal inference)
- **Base (discovery GWAS) and target/validation samples must be independent**; tune (P+T / LDpred2 / PRS-CS shrinkage / quantile cut) on a separate tuning set and evaluate out-of-sample (avoid overfitting / winner's curse). Tools: PRSice-2, LDpred2 (`bigsnpr`), PRS-CS / PRS-CSx, BridgePRS
- **Ancestry portability is the central issue**: report performance **separately per target ancestry** (within-group differences can rival between-group); prefer ancestry-matched / multi-ancestry discovery + PCs; do not extend a European-derived score to other ancestries without per-ancestry validation
- Report **OR/HR per SD** (CI) + quantile **absolute risk**; discrimination (C/AUC) **and** calibration (plot + slope/intercept) in the target population — discrimination ≠ calibration
- **Incremental value is the clinical crux**: report PRS **on top of** the guideline clinical model (SCORE2/QRISK3/PCE/Tyrer-Cuzick) — ΔC-statistic (CI), NRI/IDI, net benefit — not PRS-alone AUC. A screening claim needs detection-rate-at-fixed-FPR / likelihood ratio, not AUC
- Prefer prospective/incident validation (prevalent case–control overstates utility); report against **PGS-RS** / TRIPOD+AI. Review-side probes: PG1–PG8 in `polygenic_risk_score.md`

### NHIS Claims-Based Studies

- **Guide**: Load `analysis_guides/nhis_icd10_mapping.md` for disease definition patterns
- Claims-based algorithms: N-claim rule, claim+medication, look-back period
- Always specify ICD-10 code ranges, claim count requirement, and time windows
- Charlson comorbidity index: cite Quan 2005 adaptation
- Anchor covariates to most recent data prior to index date
- Sensitivity analysis: test stricter/looser disease definitions

### Burden of Disease, Decomposition & Forecasting

- **Guide**: Load `analysis_guides/burden_decomposition_forecasting.md` before generating code
- For a burden-of-disease estimate, attributable-risk (PAF / comparative risk assessment), temporal-trend (joinpoint / AAPC), decomposition (Das Gupta; Arriaga life-expectancy), or forecast (BAPC / age-period-cohort)
- **The value-add-layer playbook** — a descriptive rate is rarely publishable alone; bolt on ONE layer: decomposition (*why* the rate changed — aging vs population growth vs epidemiological change), PAF (*how much* is modifiable), joinpoint/AAPC pre-vs-post (did a datable policy/shock bend the trend), forecast (*where* it is going), Arriaga (which ages/causes drove ΔLE)
- **Uncertainty intervals, not CIs**: report a draw-based 95% UI (2.5th–97.5th percentile of 250–500 draws propagated end-to-end); a UI crossing the null means insufficient evidence for direction, not a non-significant test
- **Single-center cohort adaptation**: three layers port onto existing follow-up without new data — trend-break (reslice around a datable guideline/scanner-era change), forecast (project a serial imaging trajectory), and global framing (place the individual-level effect next to the published GBD burden from GHDx — contextualization, not re-estimation, so no GATHER trigger). The ecological "UI-replaces-confounding-control" shortcut does **not** port: individual-level data still needs the DAG / E-value / negative-control toolkit
- Report the estimate against **GATHER** (`/check-reporting`); keep burden/attribution/decomposition/forecast descriptive or associational unless a causal design (natural experiment, MR — `analysis_guides/mendelian_randomization.md`) is in place

### Repeated Measures

- **Guide**: Load `analysis_guides/repeated_measures.md` before generating code
- **Template**: `references/templates/repeated_measures.py`
- Default method: **LMM** (handles missing data, no sphericity assumption)
- RM ANOVA only if: no missing data AND few time points AND sphericity met
- GEE for: population-averaged effects or non-normal outcomes
- Always convert wide → long format first
- **Time × Group interaction is the key result** — always report and interpret
- Generate spaghetti plot (individual trajectories) + group mean trajectory plot
- For LMM: report random effects structure, covariance structure (CS/AR1/UN), AIC/BIC
- For RM ANOVA: report Mauchly's test, epsilon, correction method (Greenhouse-Geisser)
- If missing > 5%: load `analysis_guides/missing_data.md` and apply MICE before analysis

### Covariate Pitfalls: Structural Zeros & Dose/Duration Variables

Applies to any multivariable adjustment (logistic / linear / Cox / propensity-score / survey-weighted). Two coupled failure modes around a **dose/duration variable anchored to a categorical exposure** (pack-years under smoking status, grams/week under alcohol use, cessation-duration under former-smoker):

- **Structural-zero guard (do not impute):** a never-smoker's `pack_years` is a *structural zero*, not missing-at-random — the value is known to be 0 by definition of the category. Feeding it to MICE/MNAR imputation as if it were missing fabricates a non-zero dose for unexposed subjects and corrupts the exposure contrast. Before imputing any dose/duration column, set the implied zero explicitly (`IF status == 'never' THEN dose = 0`) and impute only the genuinely-missing residual among the exposed. `/clean-data` flags categorical-implied-zero contradictions (a `never` row with a NULL dose) and ships `scripts/check_structural_zero.py`.
- **Complete-case collapse warning (use status, not dose, for adjustment):** when a dose/duration variable enters a *complete-case* multivariable model, the unexposed stratum — which carries structural zeros often stored as NULL — is dropped wholesale, collapsing n (commonly 40–60%) and distorting subgroup estimates (a small stratum can shrink to a handful of subjects). For confounder adjustment use the **categorical status** variable (never/former/current); reserve the continuous **dose** for an exposed-only (e.g., ever-smoker-restricted) *secondary* analysis. Always report n before and after model fitting and confirm the denominator did not silently collapse.

### Covariate Selection: Over-adjustment in a Cross-Sectional Outcome Model

Applies to any cross-sectional / single-visit outcome regression (the exposure and outcome are measured at one time point, so temporal order is not observed). The selection rule is **causal, not statistical**:

- **Do not adjust for a consequence or mediator of the outcome.** A covariate that the outcome physiologically *drives* sits on or after the causal path; adjusting for it is over-adjustment / collider bias and removes part of the effect under study. The signature case is a renal-function outcome: with **eGFR** as the outcome, **serum uric acid** is renally excreted (a lower eGFR mechanically raises urate), so uric acid is an outcome-consequence, not a confounder; blood pressure and HbA1c are often similarly downstream. Classify each candidate covariate against a DAG as confounder / mediator / outcome-consequence / collider, and keep only confounders in the primary model.
- **"It differs in Table 1" is not a confounder-selection criterion.** Baseline imbalance by exposure justifies *considering* a variable, but a mediator or outcome-consequence stays out regardless of how imbalanced it is. A kitchen-sink "adjust for everything that differs" model is over-adjusted by construction.
- **Report the suspect-covariate sensitivity + VIF.** Make a parsimonious, history-/design-based model the primary one; report the fuller model as a sensitivity analysis that **drops** the suspect covariate (or adds it, if you start parsimonious), and show whether the headline estimate moves. Always print VIF (collinearity between an outcome-consequence and the outcome's other correlates is common) and the n actually fitted. If dropping the covariate materially changes the estimate, propagate to the abstract and conclusion.
- **Compare adjusted-vs-unadjusted on the SAME frame (extended-adjustment missingness trap).** When an extended-adjustment model adds covariates that carry missingness, the analytic n shrinks (e.g. 84 → 49 events). Comparing that adjusted estimate to the **full-frame** unadjusted/base estimate confounds *adjustment* with *case-concentrated missingness* — it can look as if "adjustment inflated the estimate" when the drift is who-was-dropped. The fair anchor is the **unadjusted estimate refit on the reduced complete-case frame** (the same rows the adjusted model used): report unadjusted-and-adjusted **on the reduced frame** alongside the full-frame estimate, and never describe "adjustment changed the estimate" from a comparison across different frames. (Equivalently, use multiple imputation so all models share one frame.)

## Language

- Code and output: English
- Communication with user: Match user's preferred language
- Medical terms: English only

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- Does not fabricate or simulate data to fill gaps
- Does not choose analysis endpoints -- the user decides the research question
- Does not interpret clinical significance -- only statistical results
- Does not replace biostatistician review for complex designs (e.g., adaptive trials)

## Anti-Hallucination

- **Never fabricate variable names, dataset column names, or variable codings.** If a variable mapping is uncertain, output `[VERIFY: variable_name]` and ask the user to confirm against the data dictionary.
- **Never fabricate statistical results** — no invented p-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals, or sample sizes. All numbers must come from executed code output.
- **Never generate references from memory.** Use `/search-lit` for all citations.
- If a function, package, or API does not exist or you are unsure, say so explicitly rather than guessing.
