# Compliance floor — critical-item presence over headline percentage

A reporting-compliance percentage is a coarse summary. Two manuscripts at the same
percentage can differ enormously in reviewability, because **not all items carry equal
weight**. Calibrate the reviewer comment to *which* items are missing, not just how many.

## The principle

1. **Critical items are pass/fail.** For each study type there is a small set of items that
   a methods reviewer or editor treats as non-waivable. If one is MISSING, raise it as a
   Major comment **regardless of the overall percentage** — an otherwise 90%-compliant paper
   that cannot be reproduced or whose ground truth is undefined is not "90% acceptable."
2. **The overall percentage is a secondary signal**, useful for "is the reporting broadly
   thorough or broadly thin," not for a desk-reject line. Do not assert a numeric floor a
   journal has not published.
3. **The journal's own required elements are hard.** A missing structured-abstract heading,
   a missing required panel (e.g., Key Points / Summary Statement), or the wrong reporting
   checklist for the study type is a concrete, citable gap — but those facts live in
   `reviewer_profiles/` and the author guidelines; verify there, never invent them.

## Critical items by guideline (MISSING → Major / reject-risk)

These are the items most consistently treated as non-waivable. Phrase the comment as the
specific missing item, anchored to where it should appear.

| Guideline (study type) | Critical items (raise as Major if MISSING) |
|---|---|
| **CLAIM** (AI in medical imaging) | Model architecture + training procedure; ground-truth/reference-standard definition; data-partition method (train/val/test, leakage control); evaluation metrics with uncertainty |
| **TRIPOD+AI** (prediction model) | Source and types of input data; outcome definition and timing; how the model was developed and validated; performance with **calibration**, not discrimination only |
| **STARD-AI / STARD** (diagnostic accuracy) | Reference standard and its rationale; blinding of index-test vs reference readers; participant flow (2×2 recoverable); handling of indeterminate results |
| **STROBE** (observational) | Eligibility criteria and selection; outcome/exposure definitions; **how missing data were handled**; participant flow (cascade reconciles) |
| **PRISMA / PRISMA-DTA** (systematic review) | Full search strategy (≥1 database verbatim); flow diagram that reconciles; per-study risk-of-bias; pre-registration/protocol reference |

Extensions name the base instrument too (e.g., STARD **and** STARD-AI) — a manuscript that
cites only the extension and skips the base items is itself an item to flag.

## AI / radiomics methodological-quality & risk-of-bias instruments

The guidelines above answer "was it **reported**?" A separate family of instruments answers
"is it **sound**?" — methodological-quality / risk-of-bias appraisal tools. Keep the two
families distinct: do not file a reporting checklist as an appraisal tool or vice versa.
Cite the instrument by name, anchor the concern, and do not invent item content beyond the
instrument's published scope or score the paper for the authors.

| Appraisal / RoB instrument (scope + source) | Non-waivable concerns it formalizes (raise as Major if the design fails one) |
|---|---|
| **PROBAST+AI** — risk of bias + applicability for prediction models, including regression and ML/AI methods (2024/25 update of PROBAST; development and evaluation parts, four domains: participants & data sources, predictors, outcome, analysis) | Train/test independence and leakage control; adequate sample size / events / overfitting-and-optimism control; performance assessed for **calibration**, not discrimination only |
| **METRICS** — radiomics methodological quality, EuSoMII-endorsed (Insights into Imaging 2024; 30 items / 9 categories; the older **RQS** is a coarser predecessor) | Feature reproducibility/stability (test–retest, segmentation robustness, ICC); proper internal–external validation and multiplicity control; calibration |
| **APPRAISE-AI** — quantitative methodological + reporting quality of clinical-decision-support AI studies (JAMA Network Open 2023; 24 items across 6 domains: clinical relevance, data quality, methodological conduct, robustness of results, reporting quality, reproducibility) | Independent/external validation; robustness of results / error analysis; reproducibility (data + code); performance with uncertainty |

These are appraisal tools, not reporting checklists. Their **reporting** counterparts for the
same fields — **CLEAR** (radiomics reporting, the companion to METRICS) and **DECIDE-AI**
(reporting standard for early-stage clinical evaluation of decision-support AI) — belong
with the reporting guidelines above, not in this table; name them when the relevant reporting
items are missing, but do not call them risk-of-bias tools.

A reporting checklist can be fully satisfied while the appraisal instrument fails — a paper
can *report* a single best fold, an unstated threshold, or a non-independent split clearly
and still be at high risk of bias. When that happens, the appraisal concern governs the
comment (see the AO5 probe and the `optimistic_validation_reporting` exemplar), not the
reporting percentage. Open data/code is an open-science/reporting expectation, raised as such
rather than as a design-level risk-of-bias failure.

## Desk-rejection-risk signals (weigh, don't over-assert)

- A **critical item is MISSING** (above) — the strongest single signal.
- The manuscript uses the **wrong reporting guideline** for its design (e.g., a prediction
  model reported only against STROBE).
- A journal **required element is absent** (per `reviewer_profiles/` + author guidelines).
- The **reporting checklist is not uploaded** or references a stale manuscript version.

When several co-occur, say so in the Confidential Comments to the Editor as a coherent
"reporting readiness" concern, not as a list of nitpicks.

## Integration

Run `/check-reporting` first for the item-by-item table, then apply this file:
- `/peer-review` Phase 2 (reporting-guideline check) and Phase 4 self-QC.
- `/self-review` category G — flag MISSING critical items as Anticipated Major Comments.
