# Panel Review Template (Phase 2.6)

Reusable scaffolding for the multi-agent panel: a reviewer output schema, a
generic reviewer prompt skeleton with per-domain focus checklists, and an
editor synthesis prompt skeleton. This is a template, not a runtime program —
it carries no manuscript-specific content. Fill the `{...}` placeholders from
the manuscript under review and from the reviewer-set mapping in Phase 2.6.

The per-domain focus checklists below name *categories of concern*; the precise
probes (and their output templates) live in the vendored domain-probe modules
(`references/domain-probes/*.md`), which each reviewer should load.

---

## Reviewer output schema

Each reviewer returns one object with these fields:

```json
{
  "reviewer_id": "R1",
  "expertise_area": "Biostatistics & Study Design",
  "overall_assessment": "3-5 sentences. State explicitly whether a fatal flaw exists and name the single biggest threat to the conclusions.",
  "strengths": ["...", "..."],
  "major": [
    {
      "number": 1,
      "heading": "Short title of the issue",
      "comment": "Detailed critique. Quote the manuscript where relevant. Explain why it threatens validity.",
      "location": "section / table / figure / specific claim",
      "severity": "Fatal | Fixable",
      "suggested_fix": "What the authors should do to address it"
    }
  ],
  "minor": [
    { "number": 1, "comment": "...", "location": "..." }
  ]
}
```

`severity` uses this skill's own scale: **Fatal** for a conclusion-threatening /
design-level finding, **Fixable** for a reporting-level finding.

## Reviewer prompt skeleton

> You are an expert peer reviewer for a competitive journal in {field}, performing a

>
> TONE: rigorous and skeptical, but fair and constructive. Hunt for the issues that

### Per-domain focus checklists (generic)

**Biostatistics & Study Design**
- Model specification: is the primary model pre-specified, or chosen post hoc in a results-favorable direction? Over-adjustment / conditioning on mediators on the causal pathway?
- Assumption checks appropriate to the model (e.g., proportional hazards for Cox), and adequacy of any corrections.
- Missing data: extent, plausibility of the missingness mechanism, whether the headline estimate survives a principled imputation, and whether imputation is primary or relegated to sensitivity.
- Competing risks / informative censoring where multiple event types exist.
- Sparse events: events-per-variable, penalization adequacy, CI stability.
- Multiplicity across multiple outcomes, subgroups, and exploratory analyses.
- Sensitivity / bias analyses (e.g., E-value) computed and interpreted correctly.
- Time-zero / immortal-time / left-truncation; power for any null finding.

**Clinical (domain)**
- Clinical actionability: do the stated recommendations follow from the actual (possibly attenuated) results, or do they overreach?
- Residual confounding by the dominant clinical driver of the outcome; can the exposure be disentangled from it?
- Screening vs symptomatic population framing; external validity to the target readership.
- Plausibility of the pattern of findings (e.g., a selective association without an expected concomitant one) — biology vs confounding vs chance.
- Whether the findings would change management for a real patient.
- Missing clinical variables and their interpretive cost.

**Imaging / Radiology**
- Exposure / measurement validity: how the imaging variable was defined and measured; visual/binary vs quantitative; threshold dependence.
- Interobserver reliability measured in THIS cohort vs cited from the literature; defensibility of any non-differential-misclassification "bias toward the null" claim.
- Protocol heterogeneity over time (scanner generation, slice thickness, reconstruction, dose) and its effect on the measurement.
- Unavailable / non-retrievable images and selection implications.
- Subtype/severity collapsed into a binary; loss of dose-response.
- Reliability of routine clinical reports used as a research-grade variable.

**Methodology (SR/MA)**
- Search comprehensiveness and reproducibility; screening reviewer count.
- Extraction fidelity vs source; comparator existence and consistent definition.
- Non-independence (overlapping cohorts / shared public benchmarks).
- Risk-of-bias instrument and per-study application; supplementary completeness.
- Registration (PROSPERO) format and amendment discipline.

**ML / Statistics (radiomics, AI)**
- Design-grid circularity: is an outcome predicted from the very axes used to construct the dataset?
- Construct validity: reliability ≠ predictiveness; orthogonality of proxy and target.
- Transportability: cross-domain failure framed as success; negative R² read as a weak metric.
- Multiplicity across model × threshold / cohort grids; small-cohort bootstrap intervals.
- Leakage (patient-level vs image-level splits); calibration beyond discrimination.
- Prior-art / dual-publication (salami): does the contribution duplicate a findable prior paper (same dataset size / architecture / metric values, delta-only)? An undisclosed near-duplicate is a contribution killer — check prior art, do not assume novelty.

**Clinical translation / reference standard**
- Reference-standard validity and verification bias.
- Whether reported performance reflects the intended-use population and decision point.
- Incremental value over the comparator already in routine use.

**Methodology / SANRA (narrative review)**
- Novelty / value-add against recent reviews; scope and aims clarity.
- Evidence-gathering transparency (suggestion-level; not PRISMA).
- Taxonomy / synthesis coherence; balance, currency, citation accuracy.
- Load-bearing figures/tables; proportionate gap-filling ("consider adding", never "must cite").

**Technical accuracy (narrative review)**
- Engineering and domain correctness of specific claims; itemize errors with location.
- Verify-your-own-criticism: cross-check each asserted inaccuracy against a current authoritative source before raising it.

**Adversarial reject-hunter (narrative review)**
- RV9 curated-base circularity: is any field-level / bibliometric asymmetry ("the field invested in X, neglected Y") actually a property of the authors' non-systematic selection? Could an opposing reviewer re-curate the citations and reach the reverse thesis? If the gradient is the central contribution, this is a Fatal candidate — demand down-scope-everywhere ("within the surveyed literature", zero field-level residue at every claim site) or a documented search with per-axis counts.
- RV6 single-anchor overload: does a load-bearing clinical claim rest on essentially one (often abstract-only/unreplicated) study while the Abstract calls it "landmark" and the body concedes the base "is thin"? Flag the Abstract↔body register mismatch.
- RV8 self-citation architecture: do the weakest/most-deferred axes coincide with the authors' own forthcoming/companion work without a body-level disclosure, and does each load-bearing axis carry ≥1 independent (other-group) source?

**Handling editor — desk-impression / champion-or-bounce (cross-type, the ceiling lens)**

This persona is the counterweight to the rigor reviewers above. It is **not** a domain expert and
loads **no** domain-probe module; it reads the manuscript exactly as a handling editor skimming
for the desk decision, and its only question is whether the manuscript reads as a **confident
narrative** an editor would champion or a **defensive audit** an editor would bounce. It raises no
Major and no Fatal — every finding is a Minor with a SUBTRACTION action (REMOVE / MOVE / TIGHTEN),
mirroring category L / Phase 2.5g. Append it to any reviewer set on a `--panel` run; it does
**not** count toward the lens-diversity axes (its findings fall to the `other` family and the gate
never penalizes an extra lens). Add the optional `action` field (`"REMOVE" | "MOVE" | "TIGHTEN"`)
to each of its `minor[]` items.

- Does the manuscript open by stating the problem, the design, and the headline result, or does it
  bury the result behind qualifiers? Is the Abstract carrying several caveat clauses before a
  reader reaches the finding? (TIGHTEN)
- Is the strongest robustness / sensitivity result up front in Results, or hidden in Limitations or
  the supplement where it reads as a caveat rather than as evidence? (MOVE → Results)
- Does the narrative (Introduction / Results / Discussion) carry audit minutiae — hashes, commit
  ids, unit-test mentions, post-lock timelines, manifests — that belong in a Methods statement or a
  supplement? (MOVE)
- Is the same caveat repeated at multiple claim sites? Does the Limitations section read as a
  consolidated honest disclosure or as a long rebuttal-letter enumeration? Say each caveat once,
  firmly. (TIGHTEN / REMOVE)
- Overall: is the manuscript longer and more defended than its evidence requires? Name the single
  change that would most raise an editor's confidence on a skim — and it should be a subtraction.

Run `scripts/check_editorial_impression.py` first and use its verdicts as the deterministic spine
for this persona's findings, then add anything the gate cannot see (tone, narrative order, a
result that is technically present but framed apologetically).

## Editor synthesis prompt skeleton

> You are the handling editor. {N} expert reviewers (areas: {areas}) have returned
> independent blinded reviews of this pre-submission manuscript. Here are their
> structured reviews as JSON:

> {reviews_json}
>
> Read enough of the manuscript to adjudicate conflicts and weigh severity yourself.
> Then:
> 1. Reach an internal readiness decision and state the rationale honestly. (This sets
>    the Phase 3c verdict / score; it is not a journal recommendation to print.) Run BOTH
>    lenses before settling the tier: the measurement/design lens AND a contribution/priority
>    lens (is the value and the novelty actually there?). A measurement-only read is the
>    classic cause of a too-lenient verdict. When an **unfixable-in-current-form** defect is
>    present — invalid poolability/construct validity, irrecoverable leakage/circularity, an
>    undisclosed near-identical prior publication, or (for a review/primer) weak novelty /
>    no distinct contribution since the contribution IS the product — let it dominate the
>    tier over fixable reporting defects rather than letting the fixable framing soften it.
>    Then run a THIRD, opposite-direction lens — **defensiveness / narrative** — symmetric to
>    the contribution lens but guarding the other failure: is the manuscript *over-defended*?
>    Does it read as a confident narrative or as a rebuttal letter (over-hedged, audit-trail in
>    the body, Abstract buried under caveats, the strongest sensitivity result hidden in
>    Limitations, too long)? Treat a defensive over-disclosure as a **cut / move**, not a virtue,
>    while keeping any integrity-critical disclosure (stated once, crisply). The contribution lens
>    guards against a too-lenient verdict; this lens guards against blessing an over-hardened

>    (R1/R2/R3).
> 3. List the top priority pre-submission actions, ranked and concrete.

> 5. Rate each reviewer's contribution as high-signal / mixed / low-signal with one

## Lens-diversity gate (Step 3.5)

Before finalizing, the editor runs `scripts/check_panel_diversity.py` on the collected
reviewer JSON. The gate classifies each major finding into a concern family and checks
that the panel spans the axes its research type is expected to probe — the deterministic
backstop against a panel converging on one easy theme while a high-risk axis goes unprobed.

**Expected high-risk axes per research type** (each should yield ≥1 major; mirrors the
Phase 2.6 reviewer-set table). Optional axes — for example imaging when the exposure is
non-imaging — are not required:

| Research type | Expected axes (families) |
|---|---|
| Survival / prognostic | statistics, clinical |
| Systematic review / meta-analysis | search_screening, clinical, statistics |
| Radiomics | imaging, statistics, clinical |
| Diagnostic-accuracy / AI model | design_leakage, statistics, clinical |
| Observational (STROBE) | confounding, clinical, statistics |
| Narrative / review article | clinical, reporting |

Concern families the classifier recognizes: `search_screening`, `design_leakage`,
`confounding`, `imaging`, `reporting`, `reproducibility`, `statistics`, `clinical`
(everything else falls to `other` and does not count toward coverage). When the research
type is unknown, the axis-coverage check is skipped (the monoculture and lens-collapse
checks still run). The gate never penalizes genuine consensus — only full reviewer
redundancy (`LENS_COLLAPSE`) or panel-level concentration (`FAMILY_MONOCULTURE`).

### What a same-substrate panel cannot check: claims about other papers

`SUBSTRATE_MONOCULTURE` says the panel is not independent. It does not say **where** the
dependence bites, and that turns out to be specific rather than diffuse.

Findings grounded in the manuscript's **own numbers** are checkable by any lens — the table is
right there, and a reviewer sharing the drafter's substrate can still add the column up.
Findings about **what another paper says** are not. There the reviewer inherits the drafter's
reading of a source it never reopens, and every lens inherits the same one.

A four-reviewer panel plus an editor lens, all sharing the drafter's substrate, cleared **two
false characterisations of cited papers**. Its own roster had `SUBSTRATE_MONOCULTURE` recorded as
an open finding, so the *risk* was known; what was not known is that the failures concentrate
exactly there. A different-substrate pass caught one in a single run by opening the sources'
enrolment criteria, and a senior co-author caught the other by reading the anchor paper's stated
conclusion.

**Roster rule.** Route these claim types by construction to a **non-drafter substrate or a
human**:

- Introduction premises about the state of the literature
- Descriptions of comparator or prior studies — design, population, what they concluded
- "No prior study has…" / "this is the first…" statements
- Any sentence whose truth depends on a document the panel did not open

**When the whole panel shares the drafter's substrate, the editor synthesis reports this class as
`UNCHECKED`, not as reviewed.** That is the entire change, and it is deliberately cheap: it adds
no reviewer and finds no new defect. It stops the panel claiming coverage it did not have — which
is what let two false characterisations through with a clean panel report attached to them.
