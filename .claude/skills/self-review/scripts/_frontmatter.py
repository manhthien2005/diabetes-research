"""Strip a leading YAML front-matter block off a manuscript before prose analysis.

Several `--manuscript` detectors in this skill roll their own body extractor that filters
lines starting with `#`, `|`, `>`, `!`, list markers and code fences. A `---`-fenced YAML
front-matter block matches none of those, so the `status:`, changelog and build-note lines
that projects keep at the top of a pandoc manuscript were read as body prose. Two shipped
detectors fired on it: `check_citation_order` reported floats "cited out of order" from a
`status:` block narrating a display-item renumber, and `check_aphorism_density` listed build
notes among the manuscript's "very short declaratives".

`strip_frontmatter` removes exactly the pandoc/YAML front-matter block: an opening `---` fence
on the FIRST line and its matching closing `---` fence. If the first line is not a fence, or the
block is never closed, the whole text is returned unchanged (a lone `---` in the body — a
horizontal rule or a setext underline — is never mistaken for front matter). Same fence semantics
as `sync-submission/scripts/_yaml_frontmatter.py`; kept independent because skills are
self-contained and cross-skill imports are forbidden.

Private helper (leading underscore) so the detector-catalog glob (`check_*` / `detect_*` /
`derive_*` / `verify_refs`) never counts it. Consumers run with their own directory on
sys.path[0] (invoked as `python3 .../scripts/<name>.py`), so a sibling `from _frontmatter import
strip_frontmatter` resolves wherever the skill is installed or vendored.
