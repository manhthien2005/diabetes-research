"""Refinement terminal-state classifier -- the loop controller for self-review.

self-review runs a stack of *floor* gates (Phases 2.5-2.5f: numerical, citation,
cross-reference, leakage) that minimize rejection-for-cause, and one *ceiling* pass
(Phase 2.5g, check_editorial_impression) that recommends SUBTRACTION so an accurate
manuscript also reads confidently. Run in a loop -- self-review, revise, self-review --
the floor gates converge to a fixed point (0 Major) but nothing tells the author the
loop is *done*. Because every additive gate can always surface one more caveat, an
ungrounded refinement loop drifts: the manuscript over-hardens, the same findings get
re-raised in new words (the "Mirror Loop"), and "no edit needed" is never declared a
valid outcome.

This is NOT a detector -- it finds no defect in the manuscript, so it carries no
`check_`/`detect_`/`derive_` prefix and is not counted in the detector catalog. It reads
the JSON artifacts the other gates already wrote (qc/*.json) and classifies the
*terminal state* of the refinement loop, so the harness has a reproducible stop signal
it cannot rationalize away:

  CONTINUE             a floor gate still reports a Major (rejection-for-cause). Real
                       work remains.
  STOP_OVERHARDENING   floor at its fixed point (0 Major), but the ceiling pass flags
                       accumulation (over-hedging / buried defense). Stop ADDING; the
                       only remaining action is optional SUBTRACTION.
  STOP_MINOR_OPTIONAL  floor at fixed point; only optional Minor polish remains, ceiling
                       clean. Stop the required-work loop; present the Minor items as a
                       menu, do not loop for them.
  STOP_ZERO_EDIT       floor at fixed point (0 Major, 0 Minor), ceiling clean. The
                       manuscript is submission-ready as-is. A zero-edit result is a
                       valid PASS -- do not manufacture changes.
  INDETERMINATE        no gate artifacts found; the floor/ceiling gates have not run.

A floor gate's JSON is recognised by a `summary.n_major`; the ceiling pass by a
`summary.by_action`. The classifier is advisory and NEVER blocks -- it must not
double-gate the floor detectors, which already exit non-zero under --strict on their own
Majors. --strict is accepted for CLI parity but every non-error path exits 0. This is the
counterweight to the additive bias of the whole stack: the one step that can say "stop,
this is done".

INPUTS
  --qc-dir   directory holding the gates' qc/*.json artifacts (required).
  --out      optional JSON artifact path.
  --quiet    suppress the stdout summary.
  --strict   accepted for parity; never blocks.

OUTPUT
  A terminal-state summary (stdout) and, with --out, a JSON artifact:
    {tool, qc_dir, verdict, stop, floor_major, floor_minor, ceiling_findings,
     gates_read[], recommendation}

Stdlib-only (json / argparse / pathlib / sys). Exit codes: 0 always for a judged or
indeterminate state (advisory), 2 input/usage error (--qc-dir missing as an argument).
