"""Citation-ORDER gate — numbered floats and the in-text reference series (journal technical-check pass).

Journals (KJR, Radiology, AJR, and most others) require that numbered floats be
**cited in ascending order of first appearance** in the narrative text, evaluated
per series independently:

    main Tables   (Table 1, 2, 3, …)
    main Figures  (Figure 1, 2, 3, …)
    Suppl. Tables (Table S1, S2, … / Supplementary Table S1, …)
    Suppl. Figures(Supplementary Figure S1, … / Figure S1, …)

The same Vancouver discipline governs a FIFTH series the float scan never saw: the
**in-text reference numbers** ("[12]", "[4–11]"). They too must ascend by first
appearance, be contiguous from 1, and reach the reference-list length. A citeproc
manuscript renumbers "[@key]" at render and so has no numbers to check here; but a
HAND-TYPED "[N]" manuscript (the Word/Zotero placeholder path) has no gate at all,
and an out-of-order or gapped reference series is a desk-check reject just like an
out-of-order table.

This is a deterministic, pre-peer-review desk/technical-check item: editorial
offices "unsubmit" manuscripts for it before a reviewer ever sees them. Existing
self-review gates lint xref *resolution* (does the callout resolve to a section)
but never *order*.

What it does: scans the NARRATIVE body (everything before the first float-definition
/ back-matter section header — Figure Legends, Tables, Supplementary, References —
so a legends block that lists figures in order does not mask an out-of-order body),
extracts the first-citation position of every numbered float per series AND of every
bracketed reference number, EXPANDS ranges ("4–11" → 4..11 — so a number inside a
rendered range is never read as a false gap), and flags any series whose first-
appearance sequence is not ascending (or, for references, is gapped or overruns the list).

Verdicts:
  CITATION_ORDER (Major)  a float series is cited out of numerical order (e.g., Table 3
                          first-cited before Table 1, or Suppl. Tables cited
                          S3, S1, S2, …). Technical-check-fatal.
  CITATION_GAP  (Minor)   a float series' cited numbers are not contiguous from 1
                          (a possible missing / mis-numbered float). Report-only.
  REFERENCE_ORDER (Major) in-text reference numbers are cited out of order (e.g. [12]
                          before [5]) — the Vancouver list is mis-numbered. Ranges are
                          expanded first, so a re-citation inside "[4–11]" is not a fault.
  REFERENCE_GAP (Minor)   cited reference numbers are not contiguous from 1 (a number
                          never cited) — a missing or mis-numbered citation. Report-only.
  REFERENCE_COUNT_MISMATCH  the highest cited reference overruns the reference-list length
        (Major/Minor)     ([N] resolves to nothing → Major dangling), or the list has
                          trailing entries never cited (→ Minor). Needs a numbered list.
  UNCITED_FLOAT (Minor)   a float that HAS a legend/caption in the back matter is never
                          cited anywhere in the narrative body — a display item the reader
                          is never pointed to (uncited supplements/tables/figures are a
                          recurrent reviewer/technical-check rejection). Report-only.
  DANGLING_SECTION_XREF   an in-text "Section N" / "Section N.M" reference has no
        (Major)           matching numbered heading — the common case being a
                          journal that typesets UNNUMBERED headings, where every
                          such reference dangles at production. Name the heading
                          instead of a number. ("Supplementary/Appendix Section N"
                          is exempt — it points at the supplement.)

Fix: renumber the series by first-citation order (and reorder the float/supplement
document + remap ALL cross-references, expanding ranges like "S12–S15" by hand and
leaving non-float "S1–S6" sensitivity-spec labels untouched), or rephrase to remove
the early out-of-order citation. See ~/.claude/rules/journal-technical-check-gate.md.
