# Deterministic verifier for the incorporation-bias challenge card.
# Runs check_incorporation_bias.py on two synthetic manuscripts and diffs stdout
# against expected/. Stdlib-only, network-free. cd into HERE so the reported source
# path is the stable relative "fixture/...".
#
# Fixtures (synthetic only — no real manuscript, no PII):
#   incorp_bad.md — reference standard defines benign by resolution/decrease/stability
#                   (a size trajectory) AND Results reports "Growth ... associated with
#                   malignancy (OR 24.0)" -> INCORPORATION_BIAS (the predictor is the
#                   reference standard).
#   incorp_ok.md  — reference standard is surgical pathology + imaging follow-up (no
#                   trajectory tier); the growth-OR is then independent -> silent.
