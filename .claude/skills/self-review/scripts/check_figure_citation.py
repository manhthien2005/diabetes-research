"""Orphan figure / table gate — every numbered float must be cited in the body
(self-review Phase 2.5d cross-reference).

A figure or table that has a legend/caption but is never cited in the running text
is an "orphan": a reviewer or production editor flags it, and a journal may refuse
the float. This gate cross-checks each declared "Figure N." / "Table N." caption
against at least one in-text "Figure N" / "Table N" citation elsewhere in the body.

Verdict:
  FIGURE_ORPHAN (Minor)  a figure with a caption "Figure N." has no in-text
                         "Figure N" / "Fig. N" citation anywhere outside its caption.
  TABLE_ORPHAN  (Minor)  the same for a "Table N." caption.
  FIGURE_NOT_EMBEDDED    the manuscript has figure captions but NO markdown image link
        (Minor;          (`![...](...)`) anywhere, so every figure is captioned yet
   Major w/ --require-   absent from the rendered output — the "complete" submission that
   embedded)             ships with the legends and none of the pictures. Advisory by
                         default (a drafting manuscript may keep figures as separate
                         files); --require-embedded (the submission preflight) makes it
                         Major. Conservative: fires only when ZERO images are embedded,
                         never a per-figure guess, so it stays silent once any figure is
                         embedded.

Deterministic and caption-anchored: a line beginning "Figure N." / "Table N." (with
optional **bold**) DECLARES float N; any "Figure N" / "Table N" mention on a
DIFFERENT line CITES it. A float declared but never cited elsewhere is the orphan.
This needs no section-boundary heuristic — the caption line itself is the anchor, so
a caption that happens to reference another float still counts as citing that other
float.

Exit codes: 0 clean/report-only, 1 with --strict when any Major, 2 usage. Major is reachable two
ways: FIGURE_ATTR_STALE is Major unconditionally, and FIGURE_NOT_EMBEDDED escalates to Major under
--require-embedded. (This line used to read "none — Minor only", which was stale in the direction
that matters: it described a submission-adjacent gate as unable to block.) Stdlib-only.
