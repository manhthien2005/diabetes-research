Verification: all 44 items were compared, by number and content, against the item-by-item text of
the published update (PubMed Central record PMC11304031, whose body carries each item in full).
44/44 match, with no item missing and none invented. Item labels below are our own short names;
item 21's official name is "Intended sample size" and it does concern the testing set, as our
description says. Wording stays paraphrased — Crossref returns no Creative Commons licence.
